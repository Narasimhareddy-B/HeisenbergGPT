'''''[[w:Breaking Bad|Breaking Bad]]''''' (2008–2013) was a critically acclaimed American [[w:AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] drama about a 50-year-old high school [[chemistry]] teacher, Walter White, (played by [[w:Bryan Cranston|Bryan Cranston]]) who discovers that he has terminal lung cancer. Walter decides to use his extensive knowledge of chemistry to enter the drug trade and produce [[w:crystal methamphetamine|crystal methamphetamine]], using the profits to provide for his family after his death. The term to "break bad" is American Southeast slang meaning to turn against one's previously lawful lifestyle for one of criminal acts, usually at the cost of someone else's life or well-being.

=== ''Seven-Thirty-Seven'' [2.01] ===

:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': Adjusting for inflation &ndash; good state college &ndash; adjusting for inflation, say $45,000 a year, two kids, four years of college...$360,000. Remaining mortgage on the home, $107,000. Home equity line, $30,000, that's $137,000. Cost of living, food, clothing, utilities &ndash; say, two grand a month? I mean, that should put a dent in it, anyway. 24K a year provides for, say, ten years. That's $240,000, plus 360 plus 137...seven thirty-seven. $737,000, that's what I need. That is what I need. You and I both clear about 70 grand a week. That's only ten and a half more weeks. Call it eleven. Eleven more drug deals and always in a public place from now on. It's doable. Definitely doable.

:'''[[w:Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]''': Oh, we are dead. Dead men! ''Muerto'', or ''muerte'', or however the hell you...Jesus...
:'''Walter''': This is conjecture.
:'''Jesse''': This is conjecture?
:'''Walter''': Conjecture, yes. And conjecture isn't helping.
:'''Jesse''': Oh, my conjecture isn't helping?
:'''Walter''': Could you just state the facts?
:'''Jesse''': Alright, fine, facts in. Fact A: My phone rang like eight times last night. Dead air, hang-ups every time. Second fact? Like three in the morning, I saw that black Caddy of his cruising my neighborhood. No headlights.
:'''Walter''': No, if he wanted to kill us, he would have done it at the junkyard.
:'''Jesse''': What is that? Conjecture? Are you basing that on that he's got a normal, healthy brain or something? Did you not see him beat a dude to death for, like, nothing? And that way&ndash;that way he just kept staring at us. Saying, "You're done." You're done?! You wanna know what that means? I will tell you what that means! That means exactly how it sounds, yo! Alright, we are witnesses, we are loose ends! Right now, Tuco's thinking, "Yeah, hey, they cook good meth, but can I trust them?" What happens when he decides "no"?

<hr width="50%" />
:''[Jesse is explaining how he will kill Tuco]''
:'''Jesse''': Alright, say we set up one last sale - this is ''providing'' he doesn't decide to ''waste us'' before then. Now every time we bring in a new batch, he always tests the product, right? So... as his head is down, y'know giving it a snort, just: pop, pop, pop!
:'''Walter''': Pop, pop, pop? So, three shots?
:'''Jesse''': Yeah, three shots, or I dunno, two?
:'''Walter''': No, wait- so is it two or is it three?
:'''Jesse''': I mean, two would probably work, I guess, yeah.
:'''Walter''': Okay, two shots. Two shots in the chest, two shots in the face, what?
:'''Jesse''': Man, c'mon-
:'''Walter''': ''No'', I am just trying to understand how this works! ''[pause]'' Okay. Alright, we'll put a pin in that - but by ''now'', the big guy, Gonzo, he's probably coming at you, right?
:'''Jesse''': Yeah...
:'''Walter''': Right, so you turn towards him-
:'''Jesse''': Yeah, just ''whale on him-''
:'''Walter''': -and then, how many shots for him? I mean, he's a big guy, right? How many shots does that take?
:'''Jesse''': I dunno, three? Three shots?
:'''Walter''': Okay, three shots. Okay, Tuco and Gonzo, two men down...now, is there anyone else there? I mean, Tuco is ''usually'' with someone else, right? Maybe even a couple of guys, his- his dealers, his posse? ''[Jesse is unable to answer]'' Alright. So, we'll put a pin in that one, too. Now at this point, how many shots have been fired? I mean, you've gotta be running low, right? How many bullets does that gun even take?
:''[Jesse tries to open the gun to check, but is unable to do so, and eventually puts it down in defeat]''
:'''Walter''': How can you suggest that we kill a man and you can't even ''open the gun''? It's not that easy, is it?
:'''Jesse''': Hey, man, Walt...you did it.

<hr width="50%" />
:'''Jesse''': Look, it's got five bullets. I finally figured out how to...''[Jesse struggles to open the gun]''...look, I just finally...''[Jesse gets it open]''...I figured it out. I say we get a second gun. Right? For you? I mean, don't we like double our chances? I mean, mathematically?
:'''Walter''': I've got a better idea.
:'''Jesse''': Oh, thank God! Alright, what is it, Mr. White? Lay it on me.
:'''Walter''': ''[holds up a small bag of...]'' Beans.
:'''Jesse''': Beans?
:'''Walter''': They're castor beans.
:'''Jesse''': So what are we gonna do with them? Are we just gonna grow a magic beanstalk, huh? Climb it and escape?
:'''Walter''': We are going to process them into ricin.
:'''Jesse''': Rice and beans?
:'''Walter''': ''[rolls his eyes]'' ''Ricin.'' It's an extremely effective poison. It's toxic in small doses. Also fairly easy to overlook during an autopsy.
:'''Jesse''': Alright. Alright, so...
:'''Walter''': ''[slaps Jesse's hand away from the beans]'' Don't touch them!
:'''Jesse''': Seriously? You can get poisoned from beans?
:'''Walter''': Yes. Back in the late ‘70s, ricin was used to assassinate [[w:Georgi Markov|a Bulgarian journalist]]. The KGB modified the tip of an umbrella to inject a tiny pellet into the man’s leg. And we’re talking about an amount not much bigger than the head of a pin.
:'''Jesse''': But it... it killed him?
:'''Walter''': Oh, yes. Now, we just need to figure out a delivery device. And then, no more Tuco.

<hr width="50%" />
:'''[[w:Skyler White|Skyler]]''': I need support. Me, the almost forty-year old pregnant woman with the surprise baby on the way. And the husband with lung cancer who disappears for hours on end and I don't know where he goes and he barely even speaks to me anymore. With the moody son who does the same thing. And the overdrawn checking account. And the lukewarm water heater that leaks rusty looking crap and is rotting out the floor of the utility closet and we can't even afford to fix it! But ''oh'', I see! Now I'm supposed to go, "Hank, please, what can I possibly do to further benefit my spoiled, kleptomaniac bitch sister who somehow always manages to be the center of attention?" 'Cause God knows she's the one with the ''really'' important problems!

=== ''Grilled'' [2.02] ===
:'''Tuco''': Last two days, I couldn’t get Gonzo on the phone. He’s been acting all pouty on account of No Doze. Explain to me. How is it my fault that that little ''bitch'' did not know his place? ''[pause]'' I saw this coming. I can see the future, you know? It’s this gift that I have deep inside my head. I knew last night they were gonna come try and bust me. Gonzo...he went and snitched to the ''cops!'' That LOUSY SON OF A ''BITCH!'' I TRUSTED HIM LIKE A BROTHER! ''[takes knife]'' I WAS GOOD TO HIM! I WAS '''GOOD!!!!''' I see Gonzo, ''[starts stabbing the table with the knife]'' I'M GONNA '''GUT HIM''', I'M GONNA '''SKIN HIM''', AND I'M GONNA STUFF HIS HIDE FOR A '''HEAVY ''BAG!!!!!!!''''' And every time I hit him, IT'S GONNA BE LIKE A LESSON TO MYSELF! '''YOU NEVER, ''NEVER'' TRUST THE PEOPLE THAT YOU LOVE!'''
:'''[[w:Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]''': ''[long pause]'' So, you plan to, uh, ice Gonzo, like...future tense?
:'''Tuco''': What?
:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': You're saying, Tuco, you're saying Gonzo is currently operating as a police informant as far as you know? ''[Tuco nods]'' I'm very sorry to hear that. That's disappointing.
:'''Jesse''': Yeah. I would waste him, too, yo.
:'''Tuco''': Shut up.
:'''Jesse''': Okay.

:'''[[w:Marie Schrader|Marie]]''': Chemotherapy and marijuana go together like apple pie and Chevrolet.

<hr width="50%"/>
:''[Walter and Jesse lament over their failed attempt at poisoning Tuco with a meth sample laced with ricin]''
:'''Walter''': Chili powder. Did I not already tell you how moronic that was?
:'''Jesse''': Whatever, man. At least I tried something. Hey, it almost worked, too. How's about you leaving my gun, huh? First you boost it, then you leave it in your house. ''My'' gun.
:'''Walter''': How was I supposed to know you were chauffeuring Tuco to my doorstep?
:'''Jesse''': Well, at least he wants you alive.

<hr width="50%" />
:'''Walter''': We need a plan.
:'''Jesse''': Think, think. Let's just bum rush him, man. You know, you crack him over the head with something and I'll go for his gun.
:'''Walter''': Crack him over the head with something? ''[Walter sarcastically holds up a fly swatter]''
:'''Jesse''': You got the C, man, alright? You're as good as checked out already, okay? You should be all like sacrificial, jumping on a grenade, yo. Just...
:'''Walter''': Oh, so my life is not the priority here because I'm gonna be dead soon anyway? That's your point?
:'''Jesse''': Uh, yeah?

:''[Hector, Tuco's invalid uncle, keeps ringing his bell after catching Walter and Jesse attempting to poison Tuco's food]''
:'''Tuco''': What? What do you want?! No. Don't even tell me you're hungry. Don't go there. ''[Tuco notices Hector is staring at Walter and Jesse]'' Hahaha! Are you mad doggin' them, ''tio''? What, you don't like them? ''[Hector rings the bell]'' One ding. That means yes. ''Tio'' don't like you. Why don't you like them, ''tio''? You don't trust them? ''[Hector rings the bell]'' Why don't you trust them, tio?
:'''Walter''': Tuco, c'mon, hey, he's, there's clearly some dementia. He's not lucid.
:'''Tuco''': Shh! Did they do something to you, ''tio''? Was it something that you don't like? ''[Hector rings the bell]'' What did they do to you? ''WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY TIO?!''
:'''Walter''': Nothing, nothing.
:'''Tuco''': ''BULLSHIT! MY TIO DOES NOT LIE!''
:'''Walter''': I don't know. I swear, I don't know. I, no, I, it, maybe it was, I did change the channel on his TV, but, uh...
:'''Jesse''': Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it. While you were cooking, you know, he was watching one of those, uh, those, uh, telenovels, y'know, with all those ripe honeys on it? Y'know, he was really into it. I told you not to change the channel, man! Y'know, dude needs his eye candy. That's it!
:'''Tuco''': Hahahahaha! ''Tio!'' Is that it, ''tio?'' Is that it, ''tio?'' Did they change your ''mamitas?'' ''[Hector is silent]'' What are you telling me, ''tio?'' Huh? Are they punking me? ''[Hector rings the bell]''
:''[Tuco slowly walks toward Jesse]''
:'''Jesse''': Hey...no...no, man. No...
:'''Tuco''': ''COME HERE!''
:'''Jesse''': Don't shoot!
:''[Tuco grabs Jesse and drags him outside]''
:'''Walter''': No, no, Tuco!
:''[Walter runs after them as Tuco begins to beat up Jesse]''
:'''Walter''': Tuco...
:'''Tuco''': ''SHUT UP!''
:''[Tuco punches Jesse in the stomach and points the rifle at his head]''
:'''Jesse''': No, please, no! God, please, no! Oh God, I don't wanna die!
:'''Tuco''': Tell me what you did, Walter!
:'''Jesse''': Jesus, I don't wanna die! NO!
:'''Tuco''': ''TELL ME WHAT YOU DID!''
:''[Walter notices Jesse has dug up a rock]''
:'''Walter''': We tried to poison you. We tried to poison you because you are an insane, degenerate piece of filth and you deserve to die.
:''[Jesse bashes Tuco in the face with the rock. He drops the rifle into a shallow pit. Walter grabs it as Tuco and Jesse scuffle on the ground. Jesse manages to grab a small pistol tucked into Tuco's belt and shoots Tuco in the gut. Tuco screams in pain]''
:'''Jesse''': ''[kicking Tuco into the shallow pit]'' Who's the bitch now?!
:'''Walter''': Let him bleed.

:[''After Walt fakes being in a [[wikipedia:Fugue_state|fugue state]] by stripping naked in a supermarket as an explanation for his and Jesse's whereabouts'']
:'''[[w:Marie Schrader|Marie]]''': Well, which supermarket? Is it like a big one? Like a chain?
:'''[[w:Skyler White|Skyler]]''': Marie...
:'''Marie''': Don't get me wrong. I think it's just great that he's, y'know, back and he's feeling better. I just, I mean, he...naked. He was ''naked'' naked in a supermarket. It wasn't Whole Foods, was it?

<hr width="50%" />
:''[Hank is interrogating Jesse about his car being found at Tuco's hideout]''
:'''[[w:Hank Schrader|Hank]]''': So who's your chief, little Injun?
:'''[[w:Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]''': What? What does that even mean?
:'''Hank''': It means I think your story's bullshit. I think you know who Tuco Salamanca was. I think your car was there because ''you'' were there. Tuco had a bullet in him when I got there and I think you know something about that, too.
:'''Jesse''': So what're you saying? Like, I shot someone with, like, a gun?
:'''Hank''': You? No. Only shooting that you do is into a Kleenex.

<hr width="50%" />
:''[Walter is in therapy to help treat his "fugue state"]
:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': Look, doctor, I feel fine. Really. Now, if this is ''truly'' necessary, can't I continue as an outpatient?
:'''Therapist''': Walt, a fugue state is a very serious event. What if you were to disassociate when you were driving? What if you were to get into a situation where you could be shot by the police? You understand we can't allow you to leave, until we're certain what happened is a non-recurring event. Saying you feel fine doesn't solve this.
:''[Walter considers this]''
:'''Walter''': Would you tell me about patient confidentiality?
:'''Therapist''': It's very straightforward; without your permission, I can't disclose anything you tell me to anyone.
:'''Walter''': What about my family?
:'''Therapist''': Not to your family, not to the police, not to anyone. The only exception would be if you threatened to kill someone...then I'd be able to tell that person, but only that person.
:'''Walter''': And you - as a medical practitioner - you abide by these strictures absolutely?
:'''Therapist''': Yes.
:'''Walter''': Alright...there was no fugue state. I remember everything. ''[stands up, removes tubing]'' The truth is... I couldn't stand to spend another second in that house. I just had to...get out, and so I left. I didn't think about it, I just did it. I-I walked for a long time, and when I couldn't walk anymore, I hitchhiked. I got as far as Gallup... ''[sighs]'' ...and then it was just time to come home.
:'''Therapist''': So, being found naked in a supermarket; that was your way of giving credibility to a lie, of avoiding questions about your disappearance? Why run away? What did you feel you had to run from?
:'''Walter''': Doctor, my wife is seven months pregnant with a baby we didn't intend. My fifteen-year old son has cerebral palsy. I am an extremely overqualified high school chemistry teacher. When I can work, I make $43,700 per year. I have watched all of my colleagues and friends surpass me in every way imaginable, and within eighteen months, I will be dead. And you ask why I ran?

:''[Hank and Gomez have had Tuco's uncle Hector brought to the interrogation room in hopes that he'll identify Jesse]''

:''[Hector rings the bell]''
:'''Hank''': What does that mean?
:'''Nurse''': That means "yes". "Yes" is a bell, "no" is no bell.
:'''Jesse''': Oh c'mon, this is bullshit! I mean look at this dude, alright? He doesn't even know what planet he's living on!
:'''Gomez''': ''Señor'', are we on the planet Mars? ''[no bell]'' Are we on the planet Saturn? ''[no bell]'' Are we on the planet Earth? ''[Hector rings the bell]'' ''Señor'', is today Friday? ''[no bell]'' Is today Monday? ''[no bell]'' Is today Tuesday? ''[Hector rings the bell]''
:'''Hank''': Okay, seems like he's all there. Let's go for it.
:'''Gomez''': ''Señor'', was this man at your house yesterday? ''[Hector does nothing]'' Señor, was this man at your house yesterday?
:'''Hank''': This guy right here, he was at your house, right? Was he doing business with your nephew Tuco?
:'''Gomez''': ''Señor'', are you scared of this man?
:'''Hank''': Nah, he's not scared. C'mon granddad, why don't you wanna help us out?

:'''Walter''': Okay. You?
:'''Jesse''': They sweated me plenty, but they finally cut me loose. So you getting out of there?
:'''Walter''' Tomorrow. So who came for you? The DEA? What'd they ask you?
:'''Jesse''': Yeah, that's the thing, y'know? Your scumbag brother-in-law took my rainy day fund.
:'''Walter''': Your what? What is that?
:'''Jesse''': My rainy day fund, $68,000, okay? Cue ball son of a bitch laughed in my face. Now I got, like, eighty bucks to my name.
:'''Walter''': Wait, wait, what does he know? Does he know it's your money?
:'''Jesse''': No, man, he doesn't know shit, okay? The plan worked. He bought it. I got bills due, man. I'm screwed.
:'''Walter''': Did he mention my name?
:'''Jesse''': No, thanks for caring.
:'''Walter''': How about the basement?
:'''Jesse''': It's clean.
:'''Walter''': And the RV?
:'''Jesse''': Badger's cousin took it to his garage. It's safe.
:'''Walter''': Can he get it running again?
:'''Jesse''': Why?
:'''Walter''': So we can cook.
:'''Jesse''': You still wanna cook? Seriously?
:'''Walter''': What's changed, Jesse?

:'''Jesse''': No, why don't you grow up, mom? Ginny wanted me here! Alright, I was the one who took care of her. Alright, I took her to her appointments and made her lunch everyday. I earned this!
:'''Mrs. Pinkman''': You did not make her lunch everyday.
:'''Jesse''': What'd you do, huh? She's lying there dying, and where the hell are you?
:'''Mrs. Pinkman''': Don't start with me.

:'''Walter''': Help me understand the math, okay? I gave you one pound, correct? You and I split $2,000 per ounce, $1,000 each. One pound - that's sixteen ounces. Sixteen ounces should net to me $16,000. ''Sixteen'', not fifteen.
:'''Jesse''': ''[quietly]'' Something came up.
:'''Walter''': Something came up?
:'''Jesse''': One of my guys got held up by a couple junkies... lost an ounce. But it's cool, okay? Skinny Pete's cool.
:'''Walter''': Oh-ho! So you're saying that your guy got robbed - or rather, ''you'' got robbed - but, it doesn't matter. Hm?
:'''Jesse''': Dude, it's called breakage, okay? Like Kmart, shit breaks.
:'''Walter''': And you're thinking this is acceptable?
:'''Jesse''': It's the cost of business, yo! You're sweating me over a grand?
:'''Walter''': Hey, look, I'm just the chemist here! I'm not the street guy, ''yo''... but it seems to me that what you call breakage is just you making a fool of yourself. I've got another technical term for you: non-sustainable business model.
:'''Jesse''': You're focusing on the negative. Six grand a ''day'', we're making. What's your problem?
:'''Walter''': What happens when word gets out, and it's open season on these clowns you've hired, hm? Once everyone knows, that ''Jesse Pinkman, drug lord,'' can be robbed with impunity?
:'''Jesse''': Man, come on-
:'''Walter''': You think Tuco had breakage? I guess it's true, he did... he broke bones. He broke the skull of anybody who tried to rip him off.
:'''Jesse''': You want another grand? Is that it?
:'''Walter''': That's not my point.
:'''Jesse''': Take it! Here!
:''[Jesse throws the money into Walter's car. Walter throws it back]''
:'''Jesse''': Look, you got fifteen thousand you didn't have yesterday! Hey, we're making bank; shit happens! My guys get what they're up against, and they're careful. So am I, and you're all tucked in at night with your precious family. So why don't you just stop being such a freak about everything?

:'''Jesse''': Yeah? Jesus, how the hell do you spell "street" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T?
:'''Skinny Pete''': Hey, man, I'm slingin' mad volume and fat stackin' benjis, you know what I'm sayin'? I can't be all about, like, spelling and shit.
:'''Jesse''': Okay. So they got names?
:'''Skinny Pete''': Hers is like, I dunno, she's just his woman is all. Him, they call Spooge.
:'''Jesse''': Spooge? Not Mad Dog? Not Diesel? So lemme get this straight, you got jacked by a guy named Spooge?

<hr width="50%"/>
:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': The man who invented the diamond. All right. [[w:Tracy Hall|H. Tracy Hall]] &ndash; write this name down. Dr. Hall invented the first reproducible process for making synthetic diamonds. I mean, this is way back in the 50's. Now today, synthetic diamonds are used in oil drilling, electronics, multi-billion dollar industries. Now at the time, Dr. Hall worked for General Electric and he made them a fortune. I mean, incalculable. You want to know how GE rewarded Dr. Hall? A $10 U.S. savings bond. ''[Walt becomes angry but calms himself]'' Anyway, a savings bond printed on carbon-based paper paid to a carbon-based man for something he made out of...carbon.

:'''Spooge''': I told ya, Diesel, we ain't holding, man.
:'''Spooge's Woman''': We shot it all.
:'''Jesse''': Yeah? You shot an ounce? In a day and a half?
:'''Spooge''': Yeah.
:'''Jesse''': Alright, tell you what. Both of you pull it out your butts right now, or I go grab a flashlight and some pliers and go exploring.

:'''Gretchen''': Let me just get this straight: Elliott and I offered to pay for your treatment, no strings attached &ndash; an offer which still stands, by the way &ndash; and you turn us down out of pride, whatever. And then you tell your wife that in fact we are paying for your treatment. Without our knowledge, against our will, you involve us in your lie, and you sit here and tell me that that is none of my business?
:''[long pause]''
:'''Walter''': Yeah. That's pretty much the size of it.
:'''Gretchen''': What happened to you? Really, Walt? What happened? Because this isn't you.
:'''Walter''': What would you know about me, Gretchen? What would your presumption about me be, exactly? That I should go begging for your charity, and you waving your checkbook around like some magic wand is going to make me forget how you and Elliott &ndash; how you and Elliott &ndash; cut me out?
:'''Gretchen''': What? That can't be how you see it.
:'''Walter''': It was my hard work. My research. And you and Elliott made millions off it.
:'''Gretchen''': That cannot be how you see it.
:'''Walter''': Oh God, that's beautifully done.
:'''Gretchen''': You left.
:'''Walter''': You are always the picture of innocence.
:'''Gretchen''': You left me.
:'''Walter''': The picture of innocence. Just sweetness and light.
:'''Gretchen''': You left me. Fourth of July weekend, you and my father and my brothers. And I go up to our room and you are packing your bags. Barely talking. What, did I dream all that?
:'''Walter''': That's your excuse? To build your little empire on my work?
:'''Gretchen''': How could you say that to me? You walked away, you abandoned us. Me, Elliott...
:'''Walter''': Little rich girl, just adding to your millions.
:'''Gretchen''': I don't even know what to say to you. I don't even know where to begin. I feel so sorry for you, Walt.

You're gonna call your mommy or your daddy or your parish priest or your Boy Scout leader and they're gonna deliver me a check for $4,650. I'm gonna write that down on the back of my business card.

=== ''Over'' [2.10] ===

:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': The upshot is that I have [[w:Radiation-induced lung injury|radiation pneumonitis]].
:'''[[w:Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]''': Damn...
:'''Walter''': Actually, it's not as bad as it sounds. It's a fairly common occurrence. Easily treated. In fact, the news is all good.
:'''Jesse''': You mean, good? You mean, like, good good? You mean, like, ''remission'' good?
:'''Walter''': Remission. Not to imply I'm cured. I still have cancer, but there's been a significant reduction in the tumors.
:'''Jesse''': How significant?
:'''Walter''': Eighty percent.
:'''Jesse''': Dude! No way!
:'''Walter''': I'm not out of the woods yet, not by any stretch...but "options" is the word they keep bandying about.
:'''Jesse''': That's awesome! Serious? That's...that's...that's great, man! My aunt, she never...I mean, y'know, at your stage I didn't even think that could happen.
:'''Walter''': ''Eh''.
:'''Jesse''': Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo! ''[Walter motions for Jesse to quiet down]'' No! You must be so psyched!
:'''Walter''': Of course. I am.
:'''Jesse''': Okay, now we...I mean, what do we...Oh! Hey, I almost forgot. ''[Jesse hands Walter a paper bag filled with money]'' So, how do you want to...y'know...proceed in light of this kickass news?
:'''Walter''': We'll take our time and stay cautious. Sell off what we have and then...well, then I guess I'm done.

<hr width="50%"/>
:'''Walter''': Um...well, it's kind of funny. When I got my diagnosis &ndash; cancer &ndash; I said to myself, y'know, "Why me?" And then, the other day when I got the good news, I said the same thing. ''[The party guests are silent with confusion]'' Anyway, uh, thank you for coming and...enjoy.
:'''[[w:Hank Schrader|Hank]]''': Wow. Inspirational.

:''[Hank takes a bottle of tequila away after Walter keeps pouring shots for Walter Jr.]''

:'''Hank''': ''[to other party guests]'' It's all right.
:'''Walter''': What are you waiting for? Bring it back!
:'''Hank''': Why don't we just call it a day? All right, pal? We good?

=== ''Mandala'' [2.11] ===

:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': God. This entire process has just been so... It's always been one step forward and two steps back. We need your help.

:''[Walt deduces that the on-duty manager of a Los Pollos Hermanos is probably the distributor who wouldn't meet with him. He summons Gus to his table]''
:'''[[w:Gus Fring|Gus]]''': What can I do for you?
:'''Walter''': Have a seat. Please. ''[Gus sits down across from Walt]'' I would like to know why you wouldn't meet with me yesterday.
:'''Gus''': I'm sorry, I'm not following.
:'''Walter''': I sat here yesterday waiting to meet with someone. I believe that person was you.
:'''Gus''': I think that you're confusing me for someone else.
:'''Walter''': I don't think I am.
:'''Gus''': Sir, if you have a complaint, I suggest you submit it through our e-mail system. I'd be happy to refer you to our website.
:'''Walter''': I was told that the man I'd be meeting with was very careful. A cautious man. I believe we are alike in that way. If you are who I think you are, you should give me another chance.
:''[Gus's demeanor suddenly changes: the open expression remains, but we are instantly made aware that this is a façade, and Gus's true self emerges.]''.
:'''Gus''': I don't think we're alike at all, Mr. White. You are not a cautious man at all. Your partner was late. And he was high.
:'''Walter''': Yes. Yes, he was.
:'''Gus''': He's high often, isn't he? ''[Walter does not answer]'' You have poor judgment. I can't work with someone with poor judgment.
:'''Walter''': Are you familiar with my product?
:'''Gus''': I've been told it's excellent.
:'''Walter''': It is impeccable. It is the purest, most chemically sound product on the market, anywhere.
:'''Gus''': That is not the only factor.
:'''Walter''': You could charge twice the current rate for what I provide and your customers would pay it, hands down. Now, who I choose to do business with on my end is not your problem. You won't see him, you won't interact with him. Forget he exists.
:'''Gus''': I have to ask why. Why him?
:'''Walter''': Because he does what I say. Because I can trust him.
:'''Gus''': How much product do you have left?
:'''Walter''': 38 pounds. Ready to go at a moment's notice. ''[Gus gets up]'' Will I hear from you?
:'''Gus''': I have your numbers. ''[softly]'' You can never trust a drug addict.

:''[As Walt gets up to leave Los Pollos Hermanos, having learned Gus's name, Victor suddenly steps in front of him and blocks him from leaving]''
:'''Victor''': 38 pounds, $1.2 million, [deliver to the] truck stop, two miles south of Exit 13 on the [[w:Interstate 25|25]]. One hour.
:'''Walter''': W-What?
:'''Victor''': One hour. You in or out?
:'''Walter''': In, in, absolutely, but I just need a little more time...
:'''Victor''': One hour. If you miss it, don't ever show your face in here again.

=== ''Phoenix'' [2.12] ===

:'''[[w:Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]''': How much?
:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': How much what?
:'''Jesse''': How much did you get for the deal?
:'''Walter''': $1.2 million.
:'''Jesse''': $600,000 each.
:'''Walter''': $480,000. Saul's cut is 20%.
:'''Jesse''' All right, so where's my money?
:'''Walter''': ''Ha!''
:'''Jesse''': What?
:'''Walter''': You are joking, right? If I gave you that money, you would be dead inside of a week.
:'''Jesse''': Yo man, look, I'm off the heroin. I didn't even like it anyway, it made me sick. And the meth, y'know, I could take it or leave it. I'm clean, Mr. White. For real.
:''[Walter tosses an empty beaker to Jesse]''
:'''Walter''': Prove it. Pee in that.
:'''Jesse''': How gay are you, seriously?
:'''Walter''': Pee in it! They're selling testing kits at the drug stores. If you are clean, I will give you every last dime. ''[Jesse is silent]'' No, huh? Well, I guess until then, you'll just have to depend on the kindness of strangers to get high. That and your little junkie girlfriend.
:''[Jesse throws the beaker at Walter. Walter ducks and it shatters against the chalkboard]''

<hr width="50%"/>
:'''Walter''': No, no, it cannot be blind luck or some imaginary relative who saves us. No, I earned that money. ''Me!'' And now my son created his own website &ndash; SaveWalterWhite.com. Soliciting anonymous donations! Do you have any idea how that makes me feel?!
:'''[[w:Saul Goodman|Saul]]''': Well, look at that. It's got [[w:PayPal|PayPal]] and everything.
:'''Walter''': Cyber-begging, that's all that is. Just rattling a little tin cup to the entire world.
:'''Saul''': ''[sarcastically]'' Yeah, there's no deep-seated issues there. Walter, I'm looking at the answer right here. It's staring me in the face. Do I have to spell it out for you?
:'''Walter''': I know, I know. You're thinking that I should be funneling money into my son's website, but absolutely not. No. I am not going to have my family think that some mystery benefactor saved us!
:'''Saul''': Not some mystery benefactor, singular. That would raise too many questions. However—stay with me here... Zombies. ''[chuckles]'' I got a guy who knows this guy, who knows this ''[[w:Rain Man (film)|Rain Man]]'' type. Right? He lives with his mother in her basement in Belarus, alright? So good luck extraditing his fat Russian ass. ''[Walter is about to leave when Saul stops him]'' Wait, wait! He's a hacker-cracker extraordinaire. This guy can hijack random desktops all around the world, turn them into zombies that do his bidding. For instance, he can make it so 20, or 30,000 ''little'' donations come in from all over the U.S. and Canada. Ten, 20, 50 bucks a pop, all paid in full—nice and neat, untraceable—from the good-hearted people of the world to Mr. Walter H. White, cancer saint. Heh. I'm getting a warm and fuzzy feeling just thinking about it.

:'''Jesse''': Is New Zealand part of Australia?
:'''Jane''': New Zealand is New Zealand!
:'''Jesse''': Right on. New Zealand, that's where they, uh, that's where they made ''[[w:The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|Lord of the Rings]]''! I say we just move there, yo! I mean, you could do your art, right? Like, you could like paint the local castles and shit, and I can be a bush pilot!

:'''[[w:Mike Ehrmantraut|Mike]]''': ''[to Jesse]'' Saul Goodman sent me. ''[pause]'' Come on, inside. Latch the door. Where is she?
:''[Jesse turns his head in the direction of his bedroom. Mike puts on gloves as he walks down the hall; he then looks around and stares briefly at Jane's body before putting Jesse's drug paraphernalia inside a bag and cleaning up the room.]'' 
:'''Mike''': Any other drugs in the house? Think hard. Your freedom depends on it. ''[Jesse shakes his head]'' What about guns? You got any guns in the house? ''[Jesse shakes his head again]'' Here's your story: You woke up. You found her. That's all you know. Say it. Say it, please. "I woke up. I found her. That's all I know." ''[Jesse begins to cry; Mike slaps him]'' Say it. "I woke up. I found her. That's all I know."
:'''[[w:Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]''': I woke up. I found her. That's all I know.

:'''Mike''': Again. Again.
:'''Jesse''': ''[in rushing tone]'' I woke up. I found her. That's all I know. I woke up. I found her. That's all I know.
:'''Mike''': Once you call it in, the people who show up will be with the Office of Medical Investigations. That's primarily who you'll talk to. Police officers may arrive, they may not. Depends on how busy a morning they're having. Typically OD's are not a high priority call. There's nothing here to incriminate you, so I'd be amazed if you got placed under arrest. However, if you do, you say nothing. You tell them you just want your lawyer and you call Saul Goodman. And do I need to state the obvious? I was not here. You put on a long sleeve shirt and cover those track marks on your arm. ''[hands Jesse a phone]'' Count down from twenty and then you dial. ''[zips up the bag with Jesse's money]'' Hang tough. You're in the home stretch.

:'''Jesse''': Yeah...
:'''Walter''': Come on, let's get out of here.
:'''Jesse''': No, nonono, no, nono, no. I'm good.

:'''Jesse''': I'm good. I'm good - right here, man. Right here.
:'''Walter''': Listen, Jesse. You are not good right here. You are not good at all, you hear? Now, you just put your arms around me. Come on. You're gonna stand up, and we're gonna- we're gonna walk out of here. Okay? ''(Jesse does so)'' We're gonna take you someplace nice and safe. That's it. Now, let's go, come on. Here we go.

:'''Walter Jr.''' None of us do. We love him.

:'''Walter''': Since when?
:'''Skyler''': I'm taking the baby with me. Marie will pick up Walter Jr. from school. You will have the house to yourself for two days. I want you to pack your things and leave.
:'''Walter''': Why would I do that?
:'''Skyler''': Hank has offered to help since you shouldn't be doing any heavy lifting.
:'''Walter''': Skyler...
:'''Skyler''': I want you gone by Monday morning. I want...I want you gone.
:'''Walter''': Okay, can you at least tell me why?
:'''Skyler''': Because you're a liar, Walt. Two cell phones after all.
:'''Walter''': What?
:'''Skyler''': Right before your surgery, I asked if you had packed your cell phone and you said, "Which one?"
:'''Walter''': When? Skyler, I was medicated. I mean, I could have said the world was flat.
:'''Skyler''': You know what I think? I think you accidentally told the truth.
:'''Walter''': Honey, we have been over this. Asked and answered, right? There&ndash;
:'''Skyler''': But then it got me thinking again about the all the strange behavior. Not the least of which was the disappearance. Out of my mind with worry, calling hospitals, checking the morgue. Your fugue state? I had to believe that, didn't I? I had to find a way. I mean, who would lie about such a thing?
:'''Walter''': You tell me, Skyler. You tell me exactly what it is you think I'm lying about. What, an affair? I'm having an affair? Is that what you think?
:'''Skyler''': That's what I was thinking, yeah. For the last few weeks.
:'''Walter''': With whom? Who am I having an affair with?
:'''Skyler''': Well, my guess was Gretchen Schwartz. Something was going on between you. I just knew.
:'''Walter''': Jesus, Skyler. Get me a Bible to swear on, if that's what it takes. I am not having an affair with Gretchen!
:'''Skyler''': Oh, I know. I know you're not. 'Cause I asked her. It really took me forever to get in touch with her. She was ducking my calls for weeks. So I finally left a message, "What exactly is going on between you and my husband?" I thought that'd get her attention and it did. So she called me back and she finally told me. The money? For your treatment? Gretchen and Elliott didn't give you a dime. They paid for nothing. You refused every offer they made you, but that didn't make sense because I checked with Delcavoli in the hospital and, not including your surgery, we're nearly paid up. Over $100,000. Out of where? Out of thin air? But then, I called your mother. Yeah. Thanks for that, too. But I thought, y'know, maybe she has some money that I don't know about? Maybe she contributed? It's possible. It turns out that not only is the money not your mother, she didn't even know that you have cancer. You never went to see her. I dropped you at the airport, I picked you up, you were gone for four days, and yet she swears that you were never there. Lies on top of lies on top of lies.
:'''Walter''': Skyler...
:'''Skyler''' Could you, just once, do me the courtesy of not denying it?
:''[Walter is silent. Skyler heads to the car]''
:'''Walter''': Skyler...Skyler, don't do this, please. I...I...Skyler, please don't go. ''[Skyler tries to close the car door, but Walter stops her]'' If I tell you the truth, will you stay? Stay and I will tell you everything.
:'''Skyler''': Whatever it is, I'm afraid to know.
