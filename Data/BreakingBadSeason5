'''''[[w:Breaking Bad|Breaking Bad]]''''' (2008–2013) was a critically acclaimed American [[w:AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] drama about a 50-year-old high school [[chemistry]] teacher, Walter White, (played by [[w:Bryan Cranston|Bryan Cranston]]) who discovers that he has terminal lung cancer. Walter decides to use his extensive knowledge of chemistry to enter the drug trade and produce [[w:crystal methamphetamine|crystal methamphetamine]], using the profits to provide for his family after his death. The term to "break bad" is American Southeast slang meaning to turn against one's previously lawful lifestyle for one of criminal acts, usually at the cost of someone else's life or well-being.

:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': You going to show...I don't know...some kind of mild relief that I'm alive?
:'''[[w:Skyler White|Skyler]]''': I am relieved Walt. And scared.
:'''Walter''': Scared? Scared of what?
:'''Skyler''': You.

:''[Mike learns that the police have Gus’ laptop in their possession. He starts breaking apart his cell phone after hanging up.]''
:'''Mike''': Oh, yeah. We're boned. Well... You know how they say, "It's been a pleasure"? It hasn't.
:'''[[w:Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]''': Are you gonna tell us about the laptop? Where are you goin'?
:'''Mike''': I'm getting the hell outta dodge, kid. And so should you. It's just a matter of time.
:'''Walter''': Mike, where is the laptop?
:'''Mike''': What the hell difference does it make? They got it, end of story.
:''[Walter looks at Mike]'' 
:'''Mike''': ''[scoffs]'' APD Northwest Area Command on Second. They tagged it, they filed it. It's in the system, and they locked it in their evidence room.
:'''Walter''': Alright. Alright, so describe the building.
:'''Mike''': ''[chuckles]'' Describe it? How about how you describe Fort Knox? And what are you going to do? Are you going to put on your black leotard and go dangling on the clothesline? It's a building full of cops, what else do you need to know? And why in the hell am I talking to you?
:''[Mike turns to leave]''
:'''Jesse''': Mike, we gotta do something. 
:'''Mike''': I ''am'' doing something!
:'''Jesse''': He's good with this stuff, okay? Just give him a chance.
:'''Mike''': Hey look, that laptop might as well be on the Moon. They build these evidence rooms like bank vaults, because guess what? Lunatics like you want to break into 'em. But unlike a bank vault, this is a place that is guarded twenty-four hours a day by the police. There's no way you're getting it out of there. 
:'''Walter''': Who said that we have to get it out of there? We just need to destroy what's on it.
:'''Mike''': Oh, so now you want to blow up a police station?
:'''Walter''': I don't believe I said that, no.
:'''Mike''': Nursing home full of old folks just whet your appetite, now you want to kill a bunch of cops?
:'''Walter''': I never said anything about killing anybody. I am, however, considering the possibility of a device.
:'''Mike''': A device? 
:'''Walter''': Yes, a small device. Say this device gets filed into evidence, now it is inside that room.
:'''Jesse''': What about a magnet?
:'''Mike''': You want to commit a whole other crime just to get this bomb of yours into evidence?
:'''Walter''': Bo&mdash; Who said bomb? I said a device...
:'''Jesse''': Yo, what about like a magnet?
:'''Walter''': ...an incendiary device. One quick fire is all it would take.
:'''Mike''': You don't think they have fire suppression? I'm not talking about sprinklers, I'm talking about halon, because halon doesn't destroy evidence.
:'''Jesse''': A magnet though, maybe&mdash;
:'''Walter''': Right, so a bomb then. Maybe we plant a bomb outside.
:'''Mike''': Oh, actually I knew a crew out of Fort Worth that tried to blow up an evidence room from outside. 'Bout all they did was take out a couple of hedges. You are probably talking about two feet of reinforced concrete. 
:'''Walter''': Right, then we&mdash;
:'''Jesse''': ''Or'', what about a magnet?
:'''Walter''': ''What'' magnet? What about it?
:'''Jesse''': You know, it's just like... ''[imitates the laptop impacting on a wall]''

:''[Walter, Jesse, and Mike drive away from the APD outpost after using an industrial magnet to wreck an evidence room.]''
:'''Jesse''': ''Yeah! Bitch!''
:'''[[w:Mike Ehrmantraut|Mike]]''': Shut up!
:'''Jesse''': Oh! Yeah!
:'''Mike''': What exactly are you celebrating? You left the truck behind!
:'''Walter''': So what?
:'''Mike''': "So what?" So what if they find prints? What if they trace it back to the wrecking yard?
:'''Walter''': They won't. There's no prints. I made sure of that. There's no paperwork on the truck, the magnet, or the batteries. Untraceable salvage, all of it. I made sure of that, too.
:'''Mike''': Well, you got all the answers. So you tell me, answer man: did all that even work just now?
:'''Walter''': Yes. It worked.
:'''Mike''': I'm supposed to take that on faith, yeah? Why? How do we know?
:'''Walter''': Because I say so.

<hr width="50%"/>
:'''[[w:Saul Goodman|Saul]]''': Alright, so first off, I'm not a marriage counselor. Nor do I take sides in this thing. And not taking sides, mind you, but you did put her in charge of your money. Which I advised against, if you'll recall. All of which is not to be construed as an "I told you so." I'm just walking you through my mental process, so to speak. 
:[''Walter sits silently.'']
:'''Saul''': So she comes to me with a problem, that she's been cooking Beneke's books. He's in dutch with the IRS, and once they audit, it's ''rio de caca'' for the both of them. To which I say, "Hey, let's involve Walt in this discussion." To which she says no, says cut Beneke a check so he can pay off the IRS. Again, not taking sides, but she really was trying to protect you. ''[beat]'' A little feedback here might be nice.
:'''Walter''': "Let's involve Walt in this discussion."
:'''Saul''': Yeah, that's what I told her. She said no.
:'''Walter''': And you didn't argue the point? You didn't think to contact me?
:'''Saul''': [''scoffs''] You were a tad preoccupied at the time, if you will recall.
:'''Walter''': Okay. So you took it upon yourself to give away $622,000 of my money to a man who had been sleeping with my wife.
:'''Saul''': She's my client, same as you. Does this arrangement get a little tricky at times? Absolutely. But I try my best, you know &ndash; ethically, mind you &ndash; my duty is your&mdash;
:'''Walter''': "Ethically?" I'm sorry, I must be hearing things. Did you actually just use the word "ethically" in a sentence? You're not [[w:Clarence Darrow|Clarence Darrow]], Saul. You're a two-bit, bus-bench lawyer. And you work for me.
:'''Saul''': Yeah, well Clarence Darrow never had a client like you ask him for something... [''Saul retrieves the ricin cigarette, in a plastic bag, from his desk.''] ...like this, okay? I put my ass on the line for you. Huell too, huh? He's got fingers like hot dogs. He coulda easily bust this in two and killed everyone in the office. But do I complain? No. Beg, borrow, or steal, I am your [[w:Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry]]. I go the extra mile. Only you never told me that kid would wind up in the hospital! You know, take that thing and get the hell out of here. You and me, we're done. 
:[''Walter rises from his seat and menacingly advances on Saul'']
:'''Saul''': What are you&ndash; Hey. Hey.
:[''Walter corners Saul and leans into his face'']
:'''Walter''': We're done when I say we're done.

:'''Walter''': ''[to Skyler]'' I forgive you.

=== ''[[w:Madrigal (Breaking Bad)|Madrigal]]'' [5.02] ===

:'''[[w:Mike Ehrmantraut|Mike]]''': ''[regarding Walt's new business proposal]'' Thanks, but no thanks.
:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': ''[beat]'' Mike, I know you don't care for me. We've had our issues, you and I. But, I would suggest that you leave emotion out of this decision.
:'''Mike''': I am. You... are trouble. ''[leans forward]'' I'm sorry the kid doesn't see it, but I sure as hell do. You are a time bomb, tick-tick-ticking. And I have no intention of being around for the boom.

:'''George Merkert''': So Hector Salamanca killed Fring. Then who gave Salamanca the bomb?
:'''[[w:Hank Schrader|Hank]]''': A whole lot of questions. Not much in the way of answers. Yet.
:'''Gomez''': The APD did find some of Fring's financials. That just might lead to something.
:'''George Merkert''': I had him out to my house. Fourth of July, cooked out in the backyard. My son shucked the corn, my daughter cut up potatoes. Fring brought sea bass. Every time I grill it now, I make a little foil pouch, just like he showed me. That whole night, we were laughing, telling stories, drinking wine. And he's somebody else completely...
:''[An expression of realization dawns on Hank's face]''
:'''George Merkert''': ...Right in front of me. Right under my nose.

<hr width="50%"/>
:''[Mike is brought to an interrogation room to be questioned by Hank]''
:'''Hank:''' Thanks for coming down. Have a seat, Mr. Ehrmantraut. ''[Mike takes a seat]'' Am I saying that right?
:'''Mike:''' Close enough.
:'''Gomez:''' So once more, you're waiving your right to have an attorney present?
:'''Mike:''' Correct.
:'''Gomez:''' Can you state that to the camera, please?
:'''Mike:''' I'm waiving my right to have an attorney present.
:'''Hank:''' Uh, okay then. We just, uh, have a few questions. You're currently employed by the Pollos Hermanos chain. Is that correct?
:'''Mike:''' Yes, I am.
:'''Hank:''' What do you do there?
:'''Mike:''' Corporate security.
:'''Hank:''' Corporate security? 
:'''Mike:''' Yeah.
:'''Hank:''' What's that? Like, uh, guarding the special sauce?
:'''Mike:''' I conduct employee background checks. I oversee loss prevention.
:'''Hank:''' At a fast-food restaurant, that's a full-time job?
:'''Mike:''' We have fourteen locations. So yes, it's a full-time job.
:'''Hank:''' Yeah, well, if I were you, I'd start sending out those résumés. ''[looks at the file]'' It says here you're a private investigator? Where are you licensed?
:'''Mike:''' New Mexico, Arizona, Utah. Every state where we operate.
:'''Hank:''' Colorado? You have some restaurants there, right?
:'''Mike:''' Colorado doesn't require licensure.
:'''Hank:''' You licensed to carry a firearm?
:'''Mike:''' Concealed carry? Yes, I am.
:'''Hank:''' Which states?
:'''Mike:''' It'd be quicker to mention the states in which I'm ''not''.
:'''Hank:''' And if we pulled your CCPs, everything would be in order?
:'''Mike:''' Well, I'm guessing you've already done that, so you tell me.
:'''Hank:''' ''[points a finger at Mike]'' You strike me as a former cop. Am I right? Where at?
:'''Mike:''' Philadelphia.
:'''Hank:''' Philly! ''[in mock astonishment]'' The City of Brotherly Love. Turns out we, uh, we know some folks there and they told us that [[w:Five-O (Better Call Saul)|your tenure as a police officer ended somewhat, uh...dramatically]]? You wanna talk about that?
:'''Mike:''' Not particularly.
:'''Hank:''' Yeah, me neither. See, I'm more interested in why Gus Fring decided to put a guy like you in charge of his corporate security. I mean, given your history, doing background checks on pimple-faced fry cooks seems like overkill. What else did you do for Fring? He must have needed help running that drug empire of his, no?
:'''Mike:''' ''[feigns ignorance]'' Drug empire? First I'm hearing about that. I don't know anything about that.
:'''Gomez:''' Hey, man. We have a guy that could put you in that underground lab and he'll testify to it. So from here on out, this can go hard or easy. So what's it gonna be?
:'''Mike:''' ''[leans forward and puts his hands on the table]'' Forget your handcuffs? I'm confused. Am I under arrest here, or am I not? ''[retracts his hands]'' You wanna state that for the camera?
:'''Hank:''' You are not under arrest, ''currently''.
:'''Mike:''' Agents, do you have any more questions for me? Because you've got me very stirred up with all these false accusations. If I'm not under arrest, I'd prefer to leave. ''[Mike gets up, and starts to walk towards the door]''
:'''Hank:''' Oh, well, I don't suppose we could talk about the $2 million in your granddaughter's name? 
:''[Mike stops in his tracks and stares at Hank]'' 
:'''Hank:''' Yeah. It seems that, uh, Fring had all these secret offshore accounts that he would deposit money into. Like, uh, well, an even dozen of them. And they're all in the names of certain people on his payroll. There was the, uh, the manager of the laundry, ''umm'', a couple guys from the Pollos distribution center. Uh, there was the owner of a chemical warehouse, a bunch of others, you know. Guys that must've been getting paid off the books. Anyway, one of the names...was '''''Kaylee Ehrmantraut'''''. Ten years old and just cute as a button. Yeah. $2 million and change we found on deposit for her. Way more than anybody else. Now, my partner here? He took one look at that and said, "Shit, man! This fifth-grade girl is the muscle behind Fring's entire operation!" I said, "Whoa, whoa, hey, partner, slow down there. Maybe it was ''actually'' her dear old granddaddy." Impressive, no? That...''[clicks his tongue]'' level of insight? ''[Mike stares at Hank and Gomez as he absorbs the realization that his funds have been seized]'' He's not impressed, Gomie.
:'''Gomez:''' Perhaps he's picturing all that money going bye-bye.
:'''Hank:''' Yeah, well, I mean, the government's gonna take every last dollar, unless... Well here's the thing, Mike&ndash; Or Michael?
:'''Mike:''' Mr. Ehrmantraut.
:'''Hank:''' Here's the thing, Mike: Lucky for ''you'', you didn't touch that money. I cannot say the same for the other eleven on the list. 
:'''Gomez:''' One of your guys is gonna roll on you, and then we'll definitely remember the handcuffs.
:'''Hank:''' Now, before that day comes, you can... do yourself a solid. You can tell us what you know. You can tell us who's still out there, and if we like your story, good things can happen.
:'''Gomez:''' Kaylee might be able to keep some of that money.
:'''Hank:''' Maybe. So what do you say?
:'''Mike:''' I don't know anything about any money. I don't know what you're talking about.

:'''Walter''': Well, you missed a good meal. The lasagna came out very well, if I do say so myself. I wrapped some up if you'd like some later. ''[pause]'' You know, it gets easier. I promise you that it does. What you're feeling right now. About Ted, everything. It'll pass. So what we do, we do for good reasons. And we've got nothing to worry about. And there's no better reason than family.

:'''Walter''': ''[to Saul]'' There is gold in the streets just waiting for someone to come and scoop it up.

:''[Walter, Jesse, and Saul argue in Saul's law office.]''
:'''[[w:Saul Goodman|Saul]]''': So you bring him ''here''? Come on! The three of us? We're the Three Amigos! All for one, one for all! We don't need a Fourth Amigo!
:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': Saul, Mike knows the business. He knows distributors.
:'''[[w:Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]''': Mike's okay.
:'''Saul''': He's okay? He said he was going to break my legs. And don't tell me he didn't mean it, okay? 'Cause he gave me the dead mackerel eyes. He meant it.
:'''Walter''': Saul, Mike threatened me. He threatened Jesse. He probably threatened someone before breakfast this morning. It's what he does. C'mon. Grow a pair.

<hr width="50%"/>
:'''Mike''': Ira and his guys are good. I mean, they know how to keep their mouth shut. And if you ''buy'' them, they're gonna stay bought, you can check into them yourself, if you like. 
:'''Saul''': I will, if it comes to that. So... do we take a vote? 
:'''Walter''': Why?

<hr width="50%"/>
:'''[[w:Marie Schrader|Marie]]''': We have another big event coming up. Have you thought about what you're going to do? ''[pause]'' Walt's birthday. ''[Skyler becomes visibly on-edge at the mention of Walt]'' Whatever you need, I'm here.
:'''[[w:Skyler White|Skyler]]''': Yeah. I&mdash;I&mdash;I don't think we're going to be doing anything this year.
:'''Marie''': What are you talking about? Of-of course we're going to do something. Skyler, he was diagnosed around his birthday, right? So it's been a whole year. Listen, I've had my problems with Walt &mdash; why he wouldn't come out of the house when we were all practically begging&mdash; whatever, water under the bridge...
:[''Skyler looks through her purse. She retrieves a pack of cigarettes.'']
:'''Marie''': ...But at this point, every year is precious. We&mdash; What are you doing?
:'''Skyler''': I...
:'''Marie''': You don't smoke. You haven't smoked since college. You can't be serious! With the baby? ''And Walt?''
:[''Skyler finally lights the cigarette, having a smoke.'']
:'''Marie''': Skyler, you're not smoking around the baby, are you? And you can't smoke here! There's got to be some rule or regulation, I'm sure! You can't force your employees to breathe secondhand smoke! I know for a fact that that is illegal&mdash;
:'''Skyler''': ''Marie, shut up.''
:'''Marie''': What? I'm sorry, but please don't speak to me like that. I am simply saying that&mdash;
:'''Skyler''': ''Will you shut up?!''
:'''Marie''': Hey!
:'''Skyler''': ''Shut the hell up!'' Shut up! Shut up!
:'''Marie''': Skyler&mdash;
:'''Skyler''': ''Shut up! Shut up!''
:'''Marie''': Please stop, I&mdash;
:'''Skyler''': ''Shut up! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!''

:'''[[w:Mike Ehrmantraut|Mike]]''': Okay. For you and you and me, $367,000 each.
:'''Walter''': Whoa, wait a minute. After the dealers got their cut, we should be looking at $1,379,560. Mike, you're short. You're almost $300,000 short. 
:'''Mike''': You're forgetting about the mules. They get a fly of twenty percent.
:'''Walter''': What?
:'''Jesse''': The drivers. They're the ones that take the product from us and the dealers.
:'''Walter''': And so transportation is worth twenty percent?
:'''Mike''': They're taking a risk. 
:'''Walter''': $275,000 worth a risk? ''[scoffs]'' What did Gus pay his mules?
:'''Mike''': Gustavo Fring didn't use mules. He didn't need 'em. He spent twenty years building his own distribution. He had sixteen refrigerator trucks running his product. And you know where they are now? Government impound. You don't like paying twenty percent, maybe you shouldn't have killed the guy.
:'''Jesse''': Hey, hey, hey. We still have our million bucks here, all right? That's for one cook. 
:'''Mike''': ''[to Walter]'' Since you're puttin' on the green eye shade, my supplier and I came to an agreement: The methylamine is free this time. But brace yourself, because the next barrel is gonna cost big. ''[Walter says nothing]'' Can we continue, or you got any more burning questions?
:''[Walter flings up his arms]''
:'''Mike''': ''[to Jesse, deducting bundles of cash from the piles]'' Okay, kid. You fronted us one-hundred-and-twenty to get us going. So that's forty from him and me, one-hundred-and-twenty.
:'''Walter''': Yes. Thank you, Jesse.
:'''Mike''': Okay. Now, Ira gets a-hundred-and-ten for our piece of the business and twenty-five per cook. That is forty-five from each of us. ''[deducts more cash bundles]'' Ira's guys get ten each per cook. ''[continues deducting bundles]'' Goodman's cut, $18,000 from each. 
:''[Mike deducts yet more bundles; Walter is quietly seething]'' 
:'''Mike''': Legacy cost. $351,000, that's $117,000 each.
:'''Walter''': "Legacy cost"?
:'''Mike''': I got nine guys. You don't know 'em, but they were part of the previous operation, and they know a lot. And right now some of 'em are in jail, and more will be soon. The feds RICO'ed their hazard pay, so we are gonna make 'em whole.
:'''Walter''': ''We'' are going to make them whole? What is this "we"? These were Gus's employees, not ours.
:'''Mike''': They might have been Gus's employees, but they're my guys. 
:'''Walter''': So what are they doing to further our interests?
:'''Mike''': The cops are looking at them very closely. We don't want them furthering our interests.
:'''Walter''': So we're paying them...''why?''
:'''Mike''': Because it's ''what you do.'' 
:'''Walter''': ''[indignantly]'' ''Ohhhh.'' "It's what you do!" Huh!
:'''Mike''': My guys are keeping their mouths shut. We make 'em whole, one hand washes the other. It's as simple as that.
:'''Walter''': ''Hm.'' It sounds like a simple shakedown, "simple as that." We're paying for their silence. That's blackmail. 
:'''Mike''': Business is my end. ''This is business'', end of story.
:''[Mike moves to take another bundle from the pile, but Walter slams it hand on the money]''
:'''Walter''': This is ''your'' problem. It should come out of ''your'' end.
:'''Jesse''': Hey, hey. Just take it out of mine. ''[Jesse forwards his share of the cash]'' Alright? Go for it. I don't care, just take it.
:''[Walter stews, seeing he's outmatched in the argument]''
:'''Walter''': ''[to Jesse]'' No. Jesse, thank you, but no. I'll pay my share. ''[gestures at his pile to Mike]'' Go ahead.
:''[Mike resumes deducting cash bundles from Walter's share]''
:'''Mike''': Let me tell you something. This is how it's gonna be from here on out. My guys are an ongoing expenditure. So you best get yourself comfortable with it.
:''[Walter examines his remains share of money]''
:'''Walter''': $137,000. ''[scoffs]'' That's less than with Fring.
:'''Mike''': Listen, Walter. Just because you shot [[w:Jesse James|Jesse James]], don't make you Jesse James.

:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': Gus Fring is dead, and he was the threat. He was the danger.
:'''[[w:Skyler White|Skyler]]''': I thought ''you'' were the danger.

<hr width="50%"/>
:'''Skyler''': There's blood on my hands, too.
:'''Walter''': What blood? Beneke?
:'''Skyler''': He's in the hospital because of me...
:'''Walter''': No.
:'''Skyler''': ...because of what I did.
:'''Walter''': Skyler, you can't beat yourself up over this thing. Please. You didn't set out to hurt anybody. You made a mistake and things got out of control. But you did what you had to do to protect your family. And I'm sorry, but that doesn't make you a bad person. It makes you a human being.
:'''Skyler''': Stop it, Walt. Just stop. I don't need to hear any of your bullshit rationales. I'm in it now. I'm compromised. But I won't &mdash; I ''will not'' &mdash; have my children living in a house where dealing drugs and hurting people and killing people is shrugged off as "shit happens!" We're back at it? Fine. But the kids stay away, and that's that.
:'''Walter''': "That's that?" That's what?
:'''Skyler''': I got them out of this house.
:'''Walter''': To a sleepover at their aunt and uncle's? They spend a day or two, Junior stays up late watching movies, and then what happens?
:'''Skyler''': We'll see.
:'''Walter''': No, I'll tell you what happens. They come home, to this house, to their parents who love them&mdash;
:'''Skyler''': No. I will not let our business endanger them.
:'''Walter''': How many times do I have to say that they are not in&mdash;
:'''Skyler''': ''I said no.'' I swear to ''God'', I won't have them back here.
:'''Walter''': ''[pause]'' What are you going to do to stop it?
:'''Skyler''': Whatever it takes. Everything in my power.
:'''Walter''': Like what? I mean specifically. What is your next move?
:'''Skyler''': My next move is, maybe I hurt myself. Make it clear we need more time. Let Hank and Marie see we're still struggling.
:'''Walter''': No, more like ''you're'' still struggling. So maybe next time, I have you committed, put you in some inpatient facility while I take care of the kids myself. Is that what you want?
:'''Skyler''': So then maybe I show up with bruises on my neck. Give myself a black eye. Say that you beat me when you found out about my lover.
:'''Walter''': I see. So you involve Ted. Ah, well, that'll be fun, bringing the police up to speed on all of ''that''. But not as much as telling your sixteen-year-old son that his father is a wife-beater. Also not a very good plan. What else you got?
:'''Skyler''': I could send Junior away to school.
:'''Walter''': Oh. Now here's the conversation: "So honey, I know you've only got one year left in high school, but I would love it so much if you would drop everything, leave all your friends behind, and go to boarding school in Arizona." Do you have any other ideas? Because I'm not hearing a solution to your problem. How are you going to save our kids from this "terrible" environment?
:'''Skyler''': I...
:'''Walter''': What are you going to do? What, are you going to run off to France? Are you going to close the curtains, change the locks? This is a joke. Come on, Skyler! You want to take me on? You want to take away my ''children? What’s the plan?''
:'''Skyler''': ''I don’t know!'' This is the best I could come up with, okay? I&mdash;I will count every minute that the kids are away from here&mdash;away from you&mdash;as a victory. But you're right. It's a bad plan. I don't have any of your ''magic'', Walt. I don't know what to do. I'm a coward. I&mdash;I can't go to the police, I can't stop laundering your money, I can't keep you out of this house, I can’t even keep you out of my bed. All I can do is wait. That's it, that's the only good option. Hold on. Bide my time. And wait.
:'''Walter''': Wait for what? What are you waiting for?
:'''Skyler''': For the cancer to come back.

<hr width="50%"/>
:'''Walter''': ''[to Skyler]'' See this watch? It’s a birthday present. The person who gave me this wanted me dead, too. Not that long ago, he pointed a gun right between my eyes right here and he threatened to kill me. He changed his mind about me, Skyler. And so will you.

:'''[[w:Mike Ehrmantraut|Mike]]''': Alright, Lydia. My friends here don't know you like I do, so they are very kindly giving you one last chance. [''pulls out a notepad''] There's your script. Study it. In about 30 seconds, I'm gonna dial Agent Schrader on your line here. You're gonna pass along this information, then we'll see what we see. Now here are the rules: if you yell for help, try to give the man some kind of coded message or otherwise tip him off, I am gonna pull out my pistol and shoot you in the head.

:''[Walter Jr. opens the door.]''
:'''Walter Jr.''': What?
:'''Walter''': You know what.
:'''Walter Jr.''': Are you seriously kicking me out of my own house? Are you seriously doing that?
:'''Walter''': We're not kicking you out of anywhere, son. We love you, and this is your house as much as it is ours. But your mom and I need some time alone, and you know that. We explained that to you.
:'''Walter Jr.''': You haven't explained jack shit! You want me out? Explain to me why! Why do I have to go to Uncle Hank's? Give me the exact reason, or I'm not going anywhere!

:'''Walter''': I don't accept that. You're my wife.

:'''Walter''': I think you've seen too many movies. ''[sighs]'' Our children are ''not'' in danger.
:'''Skyler''': Just a couple of days ago, you told me that a man held a gun to your head. You said it like it was a point of pride. There's nothing you can say that'll convince me there won't come a day that somebody will come knocking on that door looking to harm you or me or all of us. And when that day comes, the children cannot be here. You agree to that, and I will be whatever kind of partner you want me to be.

=== ''[[w:Buyout (Breaking Bad)|Buyout]]'' [5.06]===
:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': Have you heard of a company called Gray Matter? Well, I cofounded it in grad school with a couple of friends. Actually, I was the one who named it. And back then, it just, oh, small time. We had a couple of patents pending, but nothing Earth-shattering. Of course, we all knew the potential. Hell, we were gonna take the world by storm. And then, well, something happened between the three of us. I'm not going to go into detail, but for personal reasons I decided to leave the company. And I sold my share to my two partners. I took a buyout for $5,000. Now at the time, it was a lot of money for me. Care to guess what that company is worth now?
:'''[[w:Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]''': Millions?
:'''Walter''': Billions. With a B. $2.16 billion as of last Friday. I look it up every week. And I sold my share, my potential, for $5,000. I sold my kids' birthright for a few months' rent.
:'''Jesse''': This isn't the same thing.
:'''Walter''': Jesse, you asked me if I was in the meth business or the money business. Neither. I'm in the ''empire'' business.
:'''Jesse''': Is a meth empire really something to be that proud of?

:''[Walter, Skyler and Jesse are having a very awkward dinner]''
:'''Jesse''': ''Mmmm'', these are great green beans, Mrs. White. I like that you got the slivered almonds going. My mom always made 'em like that. You put lemon in there too?
:'''[[w:Skyler White|Skyler]]''': They are from the deli at Albertsons. 
:'''Jesse''': Oh... Oh well, uh, well &ndash; you know &ndash; good, uh, good work on your shopping then, because these are choice. I eat a lot of frozen stuff. It's usually pretty bad. I mean, the pictures are always so awesome, you know? It's like, "Hell, yeah, I'm stoked for this lasagna!" And then you nuke it, and the cheese gets all scabby on top and it's like you're eating a scab. I mean, seriously, what's that about? It's like, yo, whatever happened to truth in advertising? You know? ''[pause; Walter and Skyler do not respond]'' So, hey, uh, how's business? The car wash? Mr. White said it's going really well. Says, like, you're, uh, a great manager.
:'''Skyler''': He did, huh?
:'''Jesse''': Yeah, he says you've got it running like a&ndash;like a machine. Like, well-oiled. Yeah.
:'''Skyler''': What else did he tell you about me?
:'''Jesse''': Oh, you know, just good stuff. Just really &ndash; you know &ndash; really good, good stuff. We don't really talk that much about &ndash; you know &ndash; personal things.
:'''Skyler''': ''[to Walter]'' Did you also tell him about my affair?
:''[Walter doesn't respond; Jesse takes a long sip from a glass of water]''
:'''Skyler''': May I please be excused? ''[leaves the table with a large glass of wine]'' 
:'''Walter''': You know, my kids are gone.
:'''Jesse''': Thank God. 
:'''Walter''': No, I don't mean they're out for the night. They're ''gone''. They're staying at my in-laws; she made me kick my own kids out of the house. She told me... that she was ''counting'' the days until my cancer came back. My wife is waiting for me to die. This business is all I have left now. It's all I have... and you want to take it away from me.

:''[Saul represents Mike at a DEA meeting]''
:'''[[w:Hank Schrader|Hank]]''': To what do we owe the pleasure?
:'''[[w:Saul Goodman|Saul]]''': Well, gentlemen, we're here to discuss the illegal harassment of my client.
:'''Hank''': ''[chuckles]'' This should be good.
:'''Saul''': Mr. Ehrmantraut has become the subject of a vicious, relentless and unwarranted DEA persecution.
:'''Hank''': Gomey, does uh... does that sound right to you?
:'''Gomez''': I have no idea what he's talking about.
:'''Saul''': Play it as cool as you like, Fonzie, but we all know you've been following my client day and night. The poor man can't even spend a few moments with his granddaughter without you guys quivering in the bushes, and peeping through your little binoculars. It's- well, it's disturbing! Heh. And it's taken a toll on his mental and physical well-being.
:'''Hank''': ''[looks Mike over]'' Your client looks fine to me.
:'''Saul''': Well, some hurts only show on the inside. Now, you guys don't even have warrants for these tails, do you?
:'''Hank''': ''Theoretically'', these "tails" you refer to would be completely within the boundaries of the law.
:'''Gomez''': You don't need a warrant to follow somebody through a public place, theoretically.
:'''Saul''': Now, that is, uh... ''theoretically'' correct. However, I would counter that an open-ended, unrestricted surveillance like this amounts to, uh... stalking. ''[Hank laughs]'' Which ''is'' illegal. Now, I don't know what it is you find so interesting about my client, and I'm not here to judge - different strokes and all - but sadly, he's just not that into you. So, I have filed a temporary restraining order against the DEA, on behalf of Mr. Ehrmantraut.
:'''Hank''': ...Where'd you get your law degree, Goodman? The same clown college you got that suit?
:'''Saul''': You know who likes this suit? Judge Papadoumian; she thinks I'm a snappy dresser. You know what Judge Papadoumian hates? Police harassment of a senior citizen. ''[Mike leers at him]'' Sorry. Expect a visit from the sheriff, Agents. You should have your ''ex parte'' within the hour.  

<hr width="50%"/>
:'''[[w:Mike Ehrmantraut|Mike]]''': Might as well get comfortable. This deal is going down tomorrow. It's happening and there's nothing you can do to stop it. Got it?
:'''Walter''': Uh huh. So it's okay for you to steal my&mdash;
:'''Mike''': ''[interrupting]'' To insure that, you and I are going to spend the rest of the night together in this office, like it's my birthday.
:'''Walter''': Mike!
:'''Mike''': When the deal is done, you'll get your money. I guarantee that.
:'''Walter''': Mike, let me cook it! I'll double your five and you still walk!
:'''Mike''': You know, I have never seen anybody work so hard not to get $5 million.
:'''Walter''': Mike, you need to listen to me.
:'''Mike''': No. Walter, the last thing I need to do is listen to you. Now sit down.

:'''Jesse''': Mike, Mike, hold on! Mr. White's got an idea!
:'''Mike''': ''[holding the gun at Walter's temple]'' I am going to count to three.
:'''Jesse''': Mike, I'm serious!
:'''Mike''': One...two...
:'''Jesse''': It's a great idea! Look, you get your $5 million, we both do, and he gets his methylamine. All right? Just hear him out!
:'''Mike''': ''[pause]'' Is that true, Walter?
:'''Walter''': Everybody wins.

=== ''[[w:Say My Name (Breaking Bad)|Say My Name]]'' [5.07] ===
:'''Declan''': Looks like you’re about a thousand gallons light here, Mike. Where’s the juice?
:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': The methylamine isn’t coming.
:'''Declan''': Why is that? Who the hell are you?
:'''Walter''': I’m the man who’s keeping it.
:'''Declan''': ''[to Mike]'' What the hell’s this? We had an agreement, right? We got our deal. So where’s the tank, Mike?
:'''Walter''': Mike doesn’t know where it is. Only I do. And you’re dealing with me now, not him.
:'''Declan''': Why don’t you just cut to what it is you want or what you think is going to happen here, alright? Because we’re going to get what we came for.
:'''Walter''': That thousand gallons of methylamine is worth more in my hands than it is in yours &ndash; or anyone else's even, for that matter. But I need distribution.
:'''Declan''': Distribution?
:'''Walter''': That’s right. So if you agree to give up your cook and sell my product instead, I’ll give you 35% of the take.
:'''Declan''': 35%! Wow, are you kidding me? Thirty-five? Mike, please tell me this is a joke. Do you know how far out we had to stick our necks out to get our hands on this cash? ''[To Walt.]'' And why the hell would we want you? You realize we have our own operation, right?
:'''Walter''': I know all about your operation. See, my partners here tell me that you produce a meth that’s 70% pure, if you’re lucky. What I produce, is 99.1% pure.
:'''Declan''': So?
:'''Walter''': So, it's grade-school tee-ball versus the New York Yankees. Yours is just some tepid, off-brand, generic cola. What I'm making is Classic Coke.
:'''Declan''': Alright. Okay, so, um, if we just waste ''you'' right here, right now, leave you in the desert; then there is no more research on the market, right? See how that works? There's only us.
:'''Walter''': Do you really want to live in a world without Coca-Cola?
:''[Declan laughs.]''
:''[Walter throws a bag of blue meth at Declan’s feet.]''
:'''Walter''': My partner tells me that your crew switched to a P2P cook because of our success. You dye your meth with food coloring to make it look like mine. You already ape my product at every turn. But now, you have the opportunity to sell it yourself.
:'''Declan''': I need you to listen to me. We’re not going to give up this deal to be your errand boys, do you understand? For what? To watch a bunch of junkies get a better high?
:'''Walter''': A better high means customers pay more. A higher purity means a greater yield. That’s $130 million of profit that isn’t being pissed away by some sub-standard cook. Now you listen to me. You’ve got the greatest meth cook in Am&ndash; no, the ''two'' greatest meth cooks in America, right here. And with our skills, you’ll earn more from that 35% than you ever would on your own.
:'''Declan''': Yeah, so you say. Just wondering why we’re so lucky. Why cut us in?
:'''Walter''': Mike is retiring from our crew. So his share of the partnership is available, ''if'' you can handle his end: distribution. And if you give him $5 million of the $15 million that you brought today. Just think of it as a finder’s fee for bringing us together. We have 40 pounds of product ready to ship. Ready to go. Are ''you'' ready?
:'''Declan''': ''[laughs]'' Who the hell are you?
:'''Walter''': You know. You all know exactly who I am. Say my name.
:'''Declan''': Do what? I don't&ndash;I don't have a damn clue who the hell you are.
:'''Walter''': Yeah you do. I'm the cook. I'm the man who killed Gus Fring.
:'''Declan''': Bullshit. Cartel got Fring.
:'''Walter''': You sure?
:''[Declan glances at Mike, who shakes his head]''
:'''Walter''': That's right. Now...''say my name''.
:'''Declan''': ... You're ''Heisenberg''.
:'''Walter''': ''[grin on face]''...''You're goddamn right.''

:'''[[w:Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]''': Mr. White. Can we just take a second and talk about all this?
:'''Walter''': Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah.
:'''Jesse''': Um...
:'''Walter''': Uh, look, you know what I think we need to talk about? Doubling down.
:'''Jesse''': Doubling down?
:'''Walter''': Mm-hmm. Cooking 100 pounds a week, not 50. As in, starting a new lab &ndash; a lab that you'll run. A cook all of your own. Why not? You deserve it. You're every bit as good as me. Well, what do you think?
:'''Jesse''': Mr. White, uh, I think that nothing has changed for me. I just want to get my money and get out.
:'''Walter''': Jesse, this... what we do... being the best at something is a very rare thing. You don't just toss something like that away. And what? You want to squander that potential &ndash; ''your'' potential? Why? To do what?
:'''Jesse''': I don't know.
:'''Walter''': Think. To do ''what'', Jesse?
:'''Jesse''': I don't know. I'll figure it out, alright?
:'''Walter''': Look at you. What have you got in your life? Nothing. Nobody. Oh wait, yes &ndash; video games and go-carts. Oh, and when you get tired of that, what then? Huh? And how soon will you start using again? Look, I know how upset you are about what happened to this boy. I am just as upset as you are.
:'''Jesse''': Are you? Really?
:'''Walter''': How can you say that to me? Jesus! I mean, I'm the one who's the father here! What, do I gonna curl up in a ball in tears in front of you? Do I have to lock myself in a room and get high to prove it to you?! What happened to that boy was a tragedy and it tears me up inside! But because it happened, what, am I supposed to just lie down and die with him? It's done! It makes me sick that it happened, just like everyone else who has died in our wake. What Todd did... ''you'' and I have done things that are just as bad.
:'''Jesse''': Yeah.
:'''Walter''': All the people that we've killed &ndash; Gale... and the rest. If you believe that there's a Hell &ndash; I don't know if you're into that &ndash; but we're already pretty much going there, right? But I'm not gonna lie down until I get there.
:'''Jesse''': What, just because I don't want to cook meth any more, I'm lying down? How many more people are gonna die 'cause of us?
:'''Walter''': No one. None. Now that we're in control, no one else gets hurt.
:'''Jesse''': You keep saying that and it's ''bullshit'' every time! Always! You know what? I'm done, okay? You just give me my money and you and I... we're done.
:'''Walter''': ''[fiddles with his apron]'' Hm... okay. Mmm. Why? ''Why'' do you want this money?
:'''Jesse''': Because it's mine? It's my cut?
:'''Walter''': But isn't it filthy blood money? I mean, you're so pure; you have such emotional depth. No, no, no, no, no, you shouldn't touch that dirty money. I'll save you from that, Jesse. Come on. ''You want it'', you want it just as much as '''I''' want it, and it's not wrong to want it. Okay? So stay, and work with me, and you can make ten times- ''twenty times'' as much.
:'''Jesse''': ...Whatever, man. You don't wanna pay me? I don't care.
:'''Walter''': Yes, you do.
:'''Jesse''': It's on you, alright? ''[Jesse starts walking out]'' I'm done.
:'''Walter''': No, you're not. You're not done. You're not ''leaving'', because if you leave ''you get nothing!'' ''[Jesse shuts the door behind him]'' '''Do you understand me?! Nothing!''' '''''JESSE!'''''

:'''Badger''': Spock has total Vulcan control over his digestion! You wanna hear this or not?
:'''Skinny Pete''': Yeah, yeah, go.
:'''Badger''': Okay, finally &ndash; Kirk, he can't take it anymore. He yorks. Now it's just down to Chekov and Spock. But Chekov, y'see, he's got a whole fat stack of quatloos riding on this. And he has figured out a way to win. He's got Scotty back in the transporter room locked in on Chekov's stomach. Every time Chekov eats a pie, Scotty beams it right out of him.
:'''Skinny Pete''': Where is he sending them, the toilet?
:'''Badger''': ''Space''.
:'''Skinny Pete''': ''Uugghh!''
:'''Badger''': There's blueberries just floating out there frozen &ndash; because it's in space &ndash; and Chekov is just shoveling them into his mouth, and&ndash;and Spock is like, "I can't believe this Russian is defeating me!" Meanwhile, Scotty's in the transporter room fiddling with levers when Lieutenant Uhura comes in and she's got, you know, her big pointies, and Scotty's fingers are all sweaty.
:'''Skinny Pete''': ''No!''
:'''Badger''': Chekov screams, he sprays blood out of his mouth...
:'''Skinny Pete''': ''Ohhhh!''
:'''Badger''': ...''Scotty beamed his guts into space!''
:'''Skinny Pete''': ''No way!''

:'''Saul''': So, uh, how is the maestro? Things have been quiet on this end.
:'''Jesse''': Haven't seen him.
:'''Saul''': Just as well. Probably. That whole thing in the jails, y'know... ''[[w:Plan and Execution|When they start to whack the lawyers]]'', that's when I draw the line.
:'''Jesse''': ''[pointing to bags of money]'' ''This''... goes to Kaylee Ehrmantraut and that goes to Mr. and Mrs. Albert Sharp. 315 East Pueblo. It's up in White Horse. It's two and a half million each, total of five.
:'''Saul''': ...Uh, Mr. and Mrs. ah, who?
:'''Jesse''': Drew Sharp's parents.
:'''Saul''': Drew Sharp. That's the kid on TV, the missing-? Why would you- scratch that. Heh, I don't know and I don't wanna know. Uh, the thing is, what those folks want is to know what happened to their boy. A sack full of cash on their doorstep, that's just gonna raise more questions. Kaylee Ehrmantraut, that's Mike's granddaughter? So this is Mike's money?
:'''Jesse''': It's mine.
:'''Saul''': It's your money? Okay, and you're giving it to Kaylee Ehrmantraut?
:'''Jesse''': It's what Mike wanted.
:'''Saul''': So you and Mike, uh... you've been in touch? ''[Jesse shakes his head]'' So we're just talking about charity? Yeah? Okay, look, you know, um, shelling out money to the ex and her little boy, I kind of get it - I mean, ''kind of'' - but this, this is a bridge too far. I'm sorry to say, kid,  but you're still gonna be two miracles short of sainthood. Heh.
:''[Jesse looks despondent]''
:'''Saul''': Brass tacks, okay? My job is to advise and my advice is: Come on, already. Mike left one step ahead of the boys in blue. You better believe his family's on the radar - a couple million bucks shows up, they're gonna snatch it ''tout suite''! The feds have already taken Kaylee's money twice! What, are you going for a hat trick?!
:'''Jesse''': I'll freaking do it myself, Saul.
:'''Saul''': Nononono! I was just- I was thinking out loud!
:'''Jesse''': Enough bullshit, Saul! Are you going to do this or not?
:'''Saul''': Yes, yes, absolutely! I live to serve!
:''[Jesse starts leaving Saul's office]''
:'''Saul''': Hey, kid, you might wanna think about cleaning up a little, getting some rest. You've looked better.
:'''Jesse''': Just get it done.

:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': Deja vu, huh? Jesus... alright, look. ''[tosses money bags on table]'' You wanna talk me through this? What you were thinking? What you asked Saul to do? I mean, come on... it's just nonsensical. Do you- do you have any explanation at all?
:'''Jesse''': ''[murmurs]'' Blood money.
:'''Walter''': What?
:'''Jesse''': [[w:Say My Name (Breaking Bad)| It's like you said.]] It-it's blood money.
:'''Walter''': I sa-? Jesus. Okay, yes, alright, I said that. I did... but it was in the heat of the moment. I was trying to win an argument, alright? And I was wrong. This is your money! Come on, you've earned it!
:''[Jesse stares off into the distance. Walter sits on the couch]''
:'''Walter''': Drew Sharp. That is a terrible memory, no doubt about it... but son, you need to ''stop focusing'' on the darkness behind you. The past is the past. Nothing can change what we've done. But now, that's over. You're out, and so am I. ''[Jesse gives him an incredulous look]'' That's right. I'm done. I've been out for about a month, but there is nothing left for us to do except to try to live... ordinary, decent lives. ''[Walter takes off his glasses]'' Why Kaylee Ehrmantraut?
:'''Jesse''': She needs someone looking after her.
:'''Walter''': Mike is perfectly capable of looking after his own granddaughter.
:'''Jesse''': ...I don't think so. I don't think he is capable. I don't think he's coming back.
:'''Walter''': Wh- What are you saying?
:'''Jesse''': You doing what you did? Offing Mike's guys? If he was out there, you'd have to look over your shoulder for the rest of your life, and that's not how you do things. So, I think he's dead, and... I think you ''know'' that.
:'''Walter''': I don't know that. I ''don't''. Listen to me: I did ''not'' kill Mike. The last time I saw him, he had his bag - the one that I brought him - and he got into his car, and he drove away and for all I know, he's alive and well. And if... if he does come back, and he doesn't understand why I had to do what I did... well then, that's on me. Jesse. ''I need you to believe this.'' It's not true. It's just not.
:'''Jesse''': ...So he's out there? He's okay?
:'''Walter''': Yes. Mike is fine, wherever he is. We both know that he can take care of himself, and he's certainly capable to provide for his own family. Okay? Jesse. '''''I need you to believe me.'''''
:'''Jesse''': ''[beat]'' Yeah. Like you said. He's alive.
:'''Walter''': Yeah. Mike's alive. Absolutely.

:'''[[w:Hank Schrader|Hank]]''': Yeah.
:'''Walter''': How you feeling?
:'''Hank''': Well, you know. I’ve been better, but… I don’t know.
:'''Walter''': Have you… Did you get to see a doctor? I mean, when one of these things last more than three days, you really should get that checked.
:'''Hank''': Yeah, no, I… I did and I’m fine. I’m, uh… I’m what they say on the upswing, you know?
:'''Walter''': Um. Good, good to hear.
:'''Hank''': Yeah.
:'''Walter''': When I heard you weren’t going in to work, I… Well, looks like you have the work coming to you. Perks of being the boss, huh?
:'''Hank''': Yeah, you know. How’s, uh… How’s things at the car wash?
:'''Walter''': Good. Yeah, really good. Hey, did you have any of that potato salad?
:'''Hank''': I don’t know. Maybe. Yeah, I mean.
:'''Walter''': No one else got sick, so you probably shouldn’t worry about it. Well, Skyler will be very happy to hear that you’re felling better. Which reminds me, I better get back to it. If there’s anything I can do…
:''[Hank nods]''
:'''Walter''': Feel better.
:''[Walter pats Hank’s back. Then Walter slowly walks out of the garage, stops and turns around.]''
:'''Walter''': You know. You're going to laugh, but I have to ask you... about ''this''.
:''[Walter holds up the GPS tracker to Hank's face.]''
:'''Walter''': Believe it or not, I found this on my car. I mean, it looks just like the GPS tracker that we used on Gus Fring, doesn't it? Back when we were tracking him, just the two of us. You wouldn't know anything about this, would you, Hank?
:''[Hank closes the garage door.]''
:'''Walter''': You okay? I gotta say, I don't like the way you're looking at me right now.
:''[After a beat, Hank punches Walt in the face and knocks him over a pile of boxes. He slams Walt against the garage door.]''
:'''Walter''': Hank.
:'''Hank''': It was you. All along, it was ''you!'' You son of a bitch. You drove me into ''traffic'' to keep me from that laundry...
:'''Walter''': Calm down.
:'''Hank''': That call I got telling me Marie was in the hospital? That wasn't Pinkman. You had my cell number. You killed ten witnesses to save your sorry ass.
:'''Walter''': Listen to me.
:'''Hank''': You bombed a nursing home. Heisenberg. ''Heisenberg!'' You lying, two-faced sack of shit!
:'''Walter''': Hank, look... I don't&ndash;I don't know where this is coming from Hank, but&ndash;
:'''Hank''': I swear to Christ, I will put you ''under'' the jail.
:'''Walter''': Let's take a breath, okay? Just listen to yourself. These wild accusations, they could destroy our family! And for what?
:'''Hank''': Don't you give me shit about family!
:'''Walter''': ''[beat]'' Hank, my cancer is back.
:'''Hank''': Good. Rot, you son of a bitch.
:'''Walter''': I'm sorry you feel that way. I wanna beat this thing. I do. I’m back on chemo, and I am fighting like hell. But the truth is in six months you won’t have someone to prosecute. But even&ndash; even if somehow you were able to convince anyone I was capable of doing these things, you and I both know I would never see the inside of a jail cell. I’m a dying man who runs a car wash. My right hand to God, that is all that I am. What’s the point?
:'''Hank''': Have Skyler bring the kids here, and then we’ll talk.
:'''Walter''': That is not going to happen.
:'''Hank''': I don't know who you are. I don't even know who I'm talking to.
:'''Walter''': If that's true &ndash; if you don't know who I am &ndash; then maybe your best course would be to ''tread lightly''.

:''[Hank meets with Skyler and tries to convince her to turn against Walt]''
:'''[[w:Hank Schrader|Hank]]''': Skyler, my&ndash; my head is spinning. And yours... I&ndash;I can't even imagine. So much makes sense to me now. You jumping in the pool. You sending us your kids, I get it. I just wished I'd seen it sooner. He's a monster. He's a&ndash; Look, I don't know what he did to you to force you to keep his secrets. If he threatened you, or whatever mind games he played. I don't know if there was abuse. But I want you to know that you can be open with me. Don't hold anything back, okay? I mean, I don't even understand if you know the full extent of this, what he's done. Not just the meth cooking, but the lives he's destroyed. But look, that's all behind you. Starting now, you're done being his victim. Because here's what we're gonna do. Sky, here's what we're gonna do: You and the kids are gonna move back to our house where you'll be safe, where he can't get to you.
:'''[[w:Skyler White|Skyler]]''': Hank, does Marie...
:'''Hank''': No, no, we'll get to that soon enough. It's just you and me right now, okay?
:'''Skyler''': Okay.
:'''Hank''': Before we, um, before we get you back to the house, I...
:''[Hank takes out a recording device and turns it on.]''
:'''Hank''': I'm gonna ask you to tell me everything you can. Um, take as long as you like. Just, um, start from the beginning when you first became aware of Walt's activities, and just&ndash; just try to be as detailed as you can.
:'''Skyler''': Um, what? Right&ndash;right here? Right now?
:'''Hank''': Sure, why not? While it's still fresh, you know? And just, um, just, um, remember to, um, just state your name and the date before you start.
:'''Skyler''': Hank, do... do we have to&ndash; have to do this right now?
:'''Hank''': No, we—we don't have to do this right now. No.
:''[Hank turns off the recording device.]''
:'''Hank''': But just here's the thing. You see, I need something solid that I can bring to my people. A statement on the record. So you testifying to Walt's criminal activities &ndash; whatever you know &ndash; can go a long, long way here. Okay, I mean, you see, building a case this big, gathering all this evidence, enough to get a conviction&ndash; we're talking a long-haul proposition here. And I don't want that bastard running out the clock. But with your testimony—
:'''Skyler''': Wait, what do you mean "running out the clock?"
:'''Hank''': His cancer. His cancer's back. So he said. He didn't tell you? Who's to say it's even true? Lying piece of shit. Look, regardless, I mean, we'll just assume. Fine. Okay? You know what? That son of a bitch looks me in the eye and he says if what I know is true, if... he'll be dead before I can prove it. The balls on that son of a&ndash; I got all these little pieces. They're all part of the story, right? But they don't mean much on their own. But when you start telling me what you know, when you start filling the gaps, I'll have him in lockup before the sun goes down.

:'''Skyler''': Hank, I... I... I think maybe... maybe I need a lawyer.
:'''Hank''': What? No, no, no, no, you don't.
:'''Skyler''': Indash; I think maybe I do.
:'''Hank''': Skyler, understand, I am here to help you. But to do that, I need your help. We start bringing in lawyers and they start putting up roadblocks where they don't need to be, and my ability to control the situation diminishes.
:'''Skyler''': Just for my own protection. It just, you know, it seems to make sense that I should have someone to talk to.
:'''Hank''': Skyler, I am your&ndash; your biggest advocate here, and I'm telling you, for your own good, you need to get out ahead of this thing. I mean, you start &ndash; you know &ndash; getting defensive, I&ndash; I'm not saying it's right, but I'll tell you it's a fact. The D.A. will look at you differently.
:'''Skyler''': But you don't know that.
:'''Hank''': Skyler, yes, Indash; I do. I've been around long enough to know. It's in your best interest to get out there and show the world you have nothing to hide. Look, no one in the world is more important to me than your sister. So believe me when I tell you that your best interest and mine are the same.
:'''Skyler''': But Hank, you telling me not to talk to a lawyer doesn't sound like that at all. It sounds like what you want... 
:'''Skyler''': What you want is to get Walter at all costs.
:'''Hank''': Okay. Okay. Let's just slow down. Slow down. You can. You can talk to a lawyer later. But right now, what we need to do, we need to go get the kids, we need to bring them to my house where they are safe. And then we need to help each other put this animal away, okay?

:'''Saul''': She just panicked.
:'''Walter''': She went right to him without even talking to me. Without a moment's hesitation.
:'''Saul''': I'm not saying it's not bad. It's bad. But it could be worse.
:'''Walter''': Really, how much worse could it be? Exactly, in your estimation?
:'''Saul''': What does she actually know? What has she seen, hmm? Nothing. It's hearsay. It's all he said, she said. I mean, the only real evidence that she can lead them to is the money, and once we take care of that, well... then they got nothing.
:'''Walter''': ''Nothing''. Hank knows, that's not nothing.
:'''Saul''': Yeah. I can't exactly see him turning the other cheek. ''[pause]'' Of course, there's always, um...

Never speak of it, never give it up. You pass it on to our children, give them everything. Will you do that? Please? Please, don't let me have done all this for nothing.

:''[Hank and Marie watch Walter's "confession" tape at home]''
:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead&ndash; murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time &ndash; something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange &ndash; uh, I guess... I guess you call it a "hit" &ndash; on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. ''[Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in "Blood Money."]'' I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.

:''[After watching the "confession" tape]''
:'''[[w:Marie Schrader|Marie]]''': Who do you think he's shown this to?
:'''Hank''': No one. It's a threat. It's what he will do if I don't back off.
:'''Marie''': I think you should show this to Ramey. Just get ahead of it. That video is a bunch of lies, Hank. Anybody who knows you will know&ndash;
:'''Hank''': $177,000? Hell's he talking about? Marie?
:'''Marie''': [[w:Bullet Points (Breaking Bad)|They told me it was gambling money]].
:'''Hank''': What was gambling money? Oh, Jesus Christ, Marie. Oh, God, no.
:'''Marie''': How was I supposed to know? How was I supposed to know where it really came from?
:'''Hank''': Why were they paying for my medical bills? What about my insurance?
:'''Marie''': Insurance wouldn't have covered the treatment that you needed, and I... I just wanted the best for you&ndash;
:'''Hank''': Why didn't you tell me?
:'''Marie''': Because I knew that you would refuse it, and without it, you may never have been able to walk again.

:'''Walter''': Saul knows a man. He specializes in getting people new identities. He would move you someplace far away, set you up with a whole new life. Yeah, I know. It sounds a little extreme. But maybe it's exactly what you need. You know, I really think that would be good for you. Clean slate. My, just think about it. You get a job. Something legitimate, something you like. Meet a girl, start a family even. Hell, you're still so damn young. You know, what's here for you now, anyway? I tell you, if I could, I'd trade places. Whole lifetime ahead of you, with a chance to hit the reset button. In a few years, this might all feel like nothing more than a bad dream.

:'''Walter''': Jesse, I am not working you.
:'''Jesse''': Yes. Yes, you are. All right? Just drop the whole concerned dad thing and tell me the truth. I mean, you're&ndash; you're acting like me leaving town is&ndash; is all about me and turning over a new leaf, but it's really&ndash; it's really about you. I mean, you need me gone, 'cause your dickhead brother-in-law is never gonna let up. Just say so. Just ask me for a favor. Just tell me you don't give a shit about me, and it's either this&ndash; it's either this or you'll kill me the same way you killed Mike. I mean, isn't that what this is all about? Huh? Us meeting way the hell out here? In case I say no? Come on. Just tell me you need this.

:'''Jesse''': No! Before! The cigarette! You stole the cigarette.

:'''Jesse''': The ricin cigarette! You had him steal it off of me! And all for that asshole Mr. White! He poisoned Brock! He poisoned Brock, and you&ndash; you helped him!

:'''Jesse''': Say it again! Tell me one more time to calm down! Come on!
:'''Saul''': I'm sorry. Yes. Okay. I had Huell lift your cigarette, but Walt made me! He told me he was helping you, he was saving you. I never would've agreed to it if I'd known what he was gonna do. Jesse, you gotta believe me. I didn't want any of this!

:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': So? Where is he?
:'''Kuby''': Still lookin'.
:'''Walter''': Where have you looked?
:'''Kuby''': His place, his folks' place, uh... this Brock kid's place... crack shacks at Siesta Hills, the Indigo, the Crystal Palace... go-kart joint on Copper Ave... uh, AA meeting off the 40... 
:'''Walter''': His buddies, Beaver and... what's his name?
:'''Kuby''': Uh, Badger and Skinny Pete. Yeah no, he's not with them.
:'''Walter''': They could be covering for him.
:'''Kuby''': ''[shakes head]'' I posed as a meter reader, I put a bug on the tall kid's mom's place; for three hours straight, all they talked about was something called ''[[w:Babylon 5 | Babylon 5]]''. I checked with my gal at APD. Uh, she said Pinkman's not in their system, so the cops don't have him.
:'''[[w:Saul Goodman|Saul]]''': ''Yet''.
:'''Walter''': Maybe he changed his mind about leaving, called your guy back.
:'''Saul''': No. Somebody misses their first chance with my guy, there's no second.
:'''Walter''': Well... keep looking. ''[starts getting out of the car]''
:'''Saul''': What then?
:'''Walter''': ...What do you mean?
:'''Saul''': I mean, Pinkman's like a bad penny. Sooner or later he's gonna turn up. I'm ''wondering'' what you wanna do when he does.
:'''Walter''': Jesse is upset about the boy. I just... need to explain to him why that had to happen.
:''[Saul and Kuby look at each other]''
:'''Saul''': Okay, but say–you know, just for the sake of argument–the kid's not in the mood for a... ''nuanced'' discussion of the virtues of child poisoning. Y'know, his plans are running more towards "stabbing you to death with a pointed stick." In ''that'' scenario, then what?
:'''Walter''': You have a suggestion?
:'''Saul''': ''[gestures to Kuby]'' We were wondering if, uh, maybe this isn't an... Old Yeller-type situation.
:'''Walter''': Old Yeller?
:'''Saul''': Yeah. Old Yeller was the best, most loyal dog there ever was. I mean, everyone loved that mutt, but one day he showed up rabid and little Timmy–for Old Yeller's own sake–had to, uh... I mean, you saw the movie.
:'''Walter''': ''[beat]'' You're full of colorful metaphors, aren't you, Saul? Belize, Old Yeller... just ''brimming'' with advice. ''[leans into Saul's ear]'' '''''Do not float that idea again.''''' ''Find him.''

:'''[[w:Skyler White|Skyler]]''': So… What’s your course of action, here?
:'''Walter''': Saul’s guy, Kuby, tracks him down, which shouldn’t take long, and when he does, I’m gonna… I’m gonna talk to him. Make him see reason.
:'''Skyler''': "Talk to him. Make him see reason." So, I’m clear, those are just euphemisms… you’re using here, right?
:'''Walter''': No, what? Wh-what does that mean? My God.
:'''Skyler''': I knew this was going to happen. I ''knew'' it. I told you that someday, someone was going to come to our door and try to hurt us. And now here we are.
:'''Walter''': No. Jesse didn't go there to hurt anyone.
:'''Skyler''': He poured gasoline all over our house, Walt! He tried to set our house on fire!
:'''Walter''': He changed his mind. He didn't do it, did he?
:'''Skyler''': Walt, you need to deal with this.
:'''Walter''': How much have you had to drink?
:'''Skyler''': ''[scoffs]'' Not nearly enough.
:'''Walter''': I–I don’t know how we got off on whatever it is we’re talking about here. But clearly, I haven’t explained the situation well enough, because this is a big overreaction. We all need to just take a deep breath and calm down, because Jesse isn't just some–some–some rabid dog. This is a person.
:'''Skyler''': A person that is a threat to us. I mean, my God, where we are now with Hank and Marie, and that awful tape we made. After everything we've done, you can't just talk to this person.

:'''Hank''': Walt's a bastard. Secret's out. We'll talk about it. But I need you to put out the lighter, okay? Look, Jesse... Jesse, I don't want to kill you. And you don't wanna be killed. So put it out.

:'''Hank''': Look, I don't wanna get into it now. But you know that thing with Walt? There's been a development.
:'''Marie''': What happened? Are you in danger?
:'''Hank''': No, no, no, no, not at all. ''[picks up suitcases]'' It's just a fluid situation, and I think it might go a little smoother if you're not here. It'll be great, you know? I booked you a spa package at La Posada. You can do that river stones thing.
:'''Marie''': Hank, what the hell is going on? Hank?
:'''Hank''': We have a guest.
:''[Hank opens the door, showing Marie a sleeping Jesse]''
:'''Hank''': He was a little keyed-up. Gave him a couple sleeping pills. ''[shuts the door]'' Okay, so listen. I bring that kid in and put him in the system, Walt's gonna find out five minutes later. You know, my last ten witnesses died in jail, remember? And I can't use a DEA safehouse without writing him up. I can't risk a motel. I know it sounds crazy, but this is the best place for him. For now. Just a day or two, tops.

I'm going to kill Jack and his entire crew, and I'm going to take back what is mine and give it to my children, and then &ndash; and ''only'' then &ndash; am I through! Do you understand?
:''[Ed enters the room.]''
:'''Ed''': Everything good?
:'''Saul''': Define "good."
:'''Ed''': You're set. Time to go. ''[to Walter]'' You'll be a little longer. Still working on transportation.
:'''Walter''': Change of plans. He's coming with me.
:'''Saul''': ''No''. No, that's&ndash;
:'''Walter''': We're going together. I can use him.
:'''Ed''': ''[pause]'' I'll give you two a minute.
:''[Ed exits]''
:'''Saul''': Hey, I'm a civilian. I'm not your lawyer anymore. I'm nobody's lawyer. The fun's over. From here on out, I'm Mr. Low Profile, just another douchebag with a job and three pairs of Dockers. If I'm lucky, a month from now &ndash; best case scenario &ndash; [[w:Better Call Saul|I'm managing a Cinnabon in Omaha]].
:'''Walter''': You're still a part of this, whether you like it or not.
:'''Saul''': I'm sorry. I don't think so.
:''[Walter menacingly approaches Saul and backs him to a wall]''
:'''Walter''': You remember what I told you? ''It's not over until''&ndash;
:''[Walter breaks into a bad coughing fit.]''
:'''Saul''': It's over.
:''[Saul exits]''

:''[Walt, hiding in New Hampshire, manages to telephone his son at school.]''
:'''Walter''': Son, it’s me. Please don’t let on. Carmen’s nearby, right? She cannot know. Son, are you there?
:'''Walter Jr.''': Y–yes.
:'''Walter''': It’s so good to hear your voice. I– I… I, uh… Son, the things that they’re saying… about me… I did wrong. I– I’ve made some terrible mistakes. But the reason were always… Things happened that… I– I never… intended. I never intended. Listen. Son, we don’t have much time. Is Louis’ family still at 4848 Newcombe? Son, your friend Louis Corbett, does his family still live in that same place up on Newcombe?
:'''Walter Jr.''': Y–yes.
:'''Walter''': Okay, good. Okay, he’s– he’s a good kid. He’s– he’s like you. He’ll understand. I’m sending Louis a package. Now, it’s addressed to Louis, but it’s for you, your mother and your sister. There’s– there’s money inside. About $100,000. Okay? I think. It was all that I could fit into the box. It has to be a secret. And if anyone says a word, the police will take it. I wanted to give you so much more. But this is all I could do. Do you understand? Son? Can you hear me? Do you understand?
:'''Walter Jr.''': ''[pause]'' You want to send money?
:'''Walter''': Yes. Good. Good, good. So, you’ll– you’ll talk to Louis, right?
:'''Walter Jr.''': You ''killed'' Uncle Hank. ''You killed him!''
:'''Walter''': Wait. Wait, son.
:'''Walter Jr.''': No. What you did to mom– You asshole. ''You killed Uncle Hank.''
:'''Walter''': Listen to me. You’ve got to listen to me.
:'''Walter Jr.''': Shut up. Just stop it. Sto–stop it. I don’t want anything from you. I don’t give a shit.
:'''Walter''': You need this money. Your mother–
:'''Walter Jr.''': ''You killed Uncle Hank. You killed him!''
:'''Walter''': Your mother needs this money. It can’t all be for nothing.
:'''Walter Jr.''': What you did– Just shut up.
:'''Walter''': Please.
:'''Walter Jr.''': Shut up.
:'''Walter''': Please.
:'''Walter Jr.''': Will you just– just leave us alone? ''You asshole. Why are you still alive? [[w:Cancer Man (Breaking Bad)|Why don’t you just– just die already?]] Just– just die''.
:''[Walter Jr. hangs up]''

:'''Receptionist''': DEA, Albuquerque district office. How may I direct your call?
:'''Walter''': I... I would like to speak to the agent in charge of the Walter White investigation.
:'''Receptionist''': Who may I say is calling?
:'''Walter''': ...Walter White.

:'''[[w:Charlie Rose|Charlie Rose]]''': ''[on television as Walter watches]'' But just yesterday, your charity, the Gretchen & Elliott Schwartz Foundation, announced a $28 million grant for drug abuse treatment centers throughout the Southwest.
:'''Elliott''': Charlie, the Southwest is our home, and we couldn't just ignore what's going on in our own backyard.
:'''Charlie''': But I'm sure you're aware that there are people who suggest other motives. [[w:Andrew Ross Sorkin|Andrew Ross Sorkin]] of ''The New York Times'' wrote a column suggesting that the grant was a kind of publicity maneuver to shore up the stock price of Gray Matter Technologies because of your association with Walter White.
:'''Elliott''': Well, that's not exactly the way...
:'''Charlie''': To cleanse yourself, so to speak, of having a methamphetamine kingpin as co-founder of your company.
:'''Elliott''': Charlie, I'm glad you brought that up. I have to believe that the investing public understands we're talking about a person who was there early on, but who had virtually nothing to do with the creation of the company, and still less to do with growing it into what it is today.
:'''Charlie''': So what was Walter White's contribution?
:'''Elliott''': You know, to be honest... Honey?
:'''Gretchen''': The company name.
:'''Elliott''': The company name. We came up with it by combining our names. Schwartz means black, black plus white makes gray.
:'''Charlie''': Hence, Gray Matter Technologies.
:'''Elliott''': Exactly. As far as I can recall, his contribution begins and ends right there.
:'''Charlie''': There are continuing reports of blue methamphetamine, considered his signature product throughout the Southwest, and some evidence of reaching as far as Europe. So my question is: is Walter White still out there?
:'''Gretchen''': No, he's not.
:'''Charlie''': You sound very sure.
:'''Gretchen''': I am. I can't speak for this Heisenberg that people refer to, but whatever... whatever he became, the sweet, kind, brilliant man that we once knew, long ago, he's gone.

:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': ''[to Elliott, who is threatening him with a fruit knife]'' Elliott, if we're gonna go that way, you'll need a bigger knife.

<hr width="50%" />
:'''Walter''': Keep stacking. It’ll all fit.
:''[Elliott and Gretchen pile Walter’s money on a table. Gretchen drops several stacks]''
:'''Walter''': That’s all right. Just– Just throw it on top. Gretchen, would you mind? We don’t want to lose any under the furniture. ''[Gretchen picks up the dropped stacks]'' Alright. That is $9,720,000.
:'''Gretchen''': Where did it come from? And why is it here?
:'''Walter''': I earned it. And you’re going to give it to my children.
:'''Gretchen''': What? Why?
:'''Elliott''': Walt, I don’t think we–
:'''Walter''': On my son’s 18th birthday, which is 10 months and 2 days from today, you will give him this money in the form of an irrevocable trust. You will tell him it is his to do with as he sees fit, but with the hope that he uses it for his college education and for the betterment of his family.
:'''Elliott''': Walt, I’m not sure that we follow. Why, um, I mean, why, in particular, would we–
:'''Gretchen''': If you wanna give your kids drug money, go do it yourself.
:'''Walter''': I can’t. My wife and son hate me. They won’t take my money. Even if they did, the federal government wouldn’t let them. But two rich benefactors, who are known for their charitable endeavors, who would think nothing of, for instance, writing a $28 million check to help victims of methamphetamine abuse. I have to think that your money would be very welcome.
:'''Gretchen''': It wouldn’t make any sense coming from us.
:'''Walter''': It certainly would. My children are blameless victims of their monstrous father, a man who you once knew quite well. Call it a beau geste. Call it liberal guilt. Call it whatever you want, but do it. And you are not to spend a single dime of your own money. If there are taxes or lawyers’ fees owed, you will take it right from here. They use my money, never yours.
:'''Elliott''': Okay, Walt, sure. That– that sounds reasonable. So what happens next?
:'''Walter''': I guess we shake on it. And I leave.
:''[Walter shakes hand with Elliott and Gretchen. He walks up to them.]''
:'''Walter''': I can trust you to do this.
:'''Elliott''': Yes. Absolutely you can.
:''[Walter turns to the window and signals someone to point red laser at Elliott and Gretchen. They shake and scream.]''
:'''Walter''': Don’t move, Don’t... Don’t dare move a muscle. You don’t want them to think that you’re trying to get away. Just breathe. Just this afternoon, I had an extra $200,000 that I would have loved dearly to leave on top of this table. Instead, I gave it to the two best hitmen west of the Mississippi. Now, whatever happens to me tomorrow, they’ll still be out there keeping tabs. And if, for any reason, my children do not get this money, a kind of… countdown will begin. Maybe a day or so later, maybe a week, a year, when you’re going for a walk in Santa Fe or Manhattan or Prague, wherever. And you’re… talking about your stock prices… without a worry in the world, and then suddenly, you’ll hear the scrape of a footstep behind you, and before you can even turn around... pop!
:''[He pokes Elliott and Gretchen in the back of their necks, making them scream]''
:'''Walter''': Darkness. ''[putting his arms around Elliott and Gretchen]'' Cheer up, beautiful people. This is where you get to make it right.
:''[Walter signals someone to stop pointing the red laser at Elliott and Gretchen, then leaves]''

:''[Badger and Skinny Pete return to Walter's car after posing as fake hitmen]''
:'''Badger''': You know, I don't exactly know how to feel about all this.
:'''Skinny Pete''': For real, yo. The whole thing felt kinda shady, you know, like, morality-wise.
:'''Badger''': Totally.
:''[Walter hands them a couple of bundles of money]''
:'''Walter''': How do you feel now?
:''[Badger and Skinny Pete take the money]''
:'''Skinny Pete''': Better.
:'''Badger''': Yeah, definitely improving.
:'''Walter''': What's this I hear about blue meth still being out there?
:'''Skinny Pete''': What do you mean?
:'''Walter''': You heard anything? Is it still being sold?
:'''Badger''': Yeah.
:'''Walter''': By whom?
:'''Badger''': It's you, right? I mean... aren't you still cooking?
:'''Skinny Pete''': Damn, man! We were sure it was you, 'cause that shit is choice, yo! Better than ever! I mean, um, you know...
:'''Walter''': ...Jesse.

:'''[[w:Skyler White|Skyler]]''': We don't want your money, Walt. I thought Flynn made that clear.
:'''Walter''': He did. And I don't have any to give you. I spent the last of it getting here. All I have to give you is this. ''[takes out a lottery ticket and hands it to Skyler]'' Call the DEA once I leave. Tell them I was here. That I forced my way in. Tell them... Tell them I wanted bacon and eggs on my birthday. And that I gave you that ticket. Those numbers are GPS coordinates.
:'''Skyler''': For what?
:'''Walter''': A burial site. That's where they will find Hank and Steve Gomez. ''[Skyler weeps]'' That's where I buried our money. The men who stole it from us. The men who still have it. They murdered Hank and Steve and put them in that hole. Now you trade that for a deal with the prosecutor. Get yourself out of this. Skyler. Skyler. All the things that I did, you need to understand–
:'''Skyler''': If I have to hear ''one more time'' that you did this for the family–
:'''Walter''': I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And... I was... really... ''I was alive''.

:'''Walter''': I want this.
:'''Jesse''': ''[notices that Walt has already been shot; lowers the gun and drops it]'' Then do it yourself.

:'''Lydia''': Is it done? Is he gone?
:'''Walter''': Yeah, it's done. He's gone. They're all gone.
:'''Lydia''': ...Todd? Who is this?
:'''Walter''': It's Walt. How are you feeling? Kind of under the weather? Like you've got the flu? That would be the ricin I gave you. I slipped it into that [[w:Stevia|stevia]] crap that you're always putting in your tea.
:'''Lydia''': Oh, my God.
