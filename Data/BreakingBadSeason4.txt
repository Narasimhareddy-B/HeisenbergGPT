'''''[[w:Breaking Bad|Breaking Bad]]''''' (2008–2013) was a critically acclaimed American [[w:AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] drama about a 50-year-old high school [[chemistry]] teacher, Walter White, (played by [[w:Bryan Cranston|Bryan Cranston]]) who discovers that he has terminal lung cancer. Walter decides to use his extensive knowledge of chemistry to enter the drug trade and produce [[w:crystal methamphetamine|crystal methamphetamine]], using the profits to provide for his family after his death. The term to "break bad" is American Southeast slang meaning to turn against one's previously lawful lifestyle for one of criminal acts, usually at the cost of someone else's life or well-being.

:''[Victor begins to cook a batch of meth on his own]''
:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': ''[quietly to Jesse]'' Bet he forgets the aluminum. Guarantee. Guarantee he forgets. ''[Victor pauses and thinks]'' Uh-huh. You don't know what the hell you're doing, do you? You forgot the aluminum. One of the first steps. ''[Victor grabs a bucket of aluminum and pours it into the batch]'' Son of a bitch.

:'''Walter''': Alright, let's talk about Gale Boetticher. He was a good man and a good chemist and I cared about him. He didn't deserve what happened to him. He didn't deserve it at all. But I'd shoot him again and tomorrow and the next day and the day after that. When you make it Gale versus me, or Gale versus Jesse, Gale loses! Simple as that. This is on you, Gus, not me, not Jesse. I mean really, what'd you expect me to do? Just simply roll over and allow you to murder us? That I wouldn't take measures &ndash; extreme measures &ndash; to defend myself? Wrong! Think again.

:''[Gus, who has changed into a lab jumpsuit, looms over Walter and Jesse with a box cutter]''
:'''Walter''': Gus, you do this, all you'll have left is an $8 million hole in the ground. This lab, this equipment, is useless without us, without Jesse and myself. You'll have no new product, you'll have no income. Your people out there won't be paid. Your distribution chain collapses. You'll have nothing. You kill me, you have nothing. You kill Jesse, you don't have me. You won't do this. You're too smart. You can't afford to do this. Please let...let us just go back to work. We're here. Let us work. We're ready to go to work. We'll just pick up right where we left off–
:''[Gus suddenly grabs Victor and slices his throat open with the box cutter. Bleeding profusely, Victor falls to the floor dead. Gus calmly takes off the bloody jumpsuit and nonchalantly washes up. On his way out, he looks back down at Walt and Jesse, who are visibly shocked and horrified at the sudden outburst of violence.]''
:'''[[w:Gus Fring|Gus]]''': ..Well? Get back to work.

:''[Walter and Jesse eat at a [[wikipedia:Denny's|Denny's]] after being released from the superlab]''
:'''Walter''': How are you doing? ''[Jesse shrugs]'' You did the only thing that you could. I hope you understand that. ''[puts his head in his hands]'' ''God.'' Any thoughts on what our next move might be?
:'''Jesse''': What next move?
:'''Walter''': Our next move. Our ''next move'', given the fact that, at the first opportunity, Gus will kill us.
:'''Jesse''': What, that wasn't an "opportunity", just now? Seemed like a pretty damn good opportunity to me.
:'''Walter''': No, no, no, no...
:'''Jesse''': ''Golden'', I'd say.
:'''Walter''': We bought ourselves some time, yes, but... the question is, how much? He'll be looking for another chemist.
:'''Jesse''': He's not going to find another chemist.
:'''Walter''': ''[unconvinced]'' Hmm...
:'''Jesse''': Where is he going to find another chemist? It's not just about somebody being able to run a lab that big - someone he can trust, someone he knows will keep their mouth shut. Yeah, good luck with that. Bet it took him ''years'' to find Gale; bet he's sorry now.
:'''Walter''': ''[pause]'' Are you sure you-
:'''Jesse''': At least now we all understand each other. Right?
:'''Walter''': What do you mean?
:'''Jesse''': I mean, him and us. We get it. ''[makes a motion of slitting his throat]'' We’re all on the same page.
:'''Walter''': Now, what page is that?
:'''Jesse''': The one that says if I can’t kill you, you’ll sure as shit wish you were dead. ''[chuckles]''

=== ''[[w:Thirty-Eight Snub|Thirty-Eight Snub]]'' [4.02] ===

:'''Lawson''': You know, mister, I've been providin' my services for the past thirty-odd years. You'd think in that time I'd learn better than to ask a man his business. Especially not one referred by the lawyer. But I feel the urge to ask you, we strictly talking defense here?
:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': Yes. Absolutely, defense. Why?
:'''Lawson''': 'Cause if it's just personal protection, aside from a bucket of money, you'd save yourself a potential felony two-spot for carrying a weapon with a defaced serial number if you'd just buy it legally.
:'''Walter''': Yeah, but... if you did have to use it, wouldn't it still be better to use one that couldn't be traced?
:'''Lawson''': This is the west, boss. New Mexico's not a 'retreat' jurisdiction. A man steps to you intent on doing bodily harm, you got every right to plant your feet and shoot to kill. Some call it a moral right and I do include myself within that class. All this to say, I'm happy to take your money, but if you're not a convicted felon, you might best be advised to bear your arms within the confines of the law.
:'''Walter''': It's for defense. ''[beat]'' Defense. I'll take it.

:'''Skinny Pete''': ''[[w:Left 4 Dead|Left 4 Dead]]'', yo. The way them bitches get all cranial when you cap 'em in the head, it's like BOOYAH!
:'''Badger''': No, no, no, man, ''[[w:Resident Evil 4|Resident Evil 4]]'' takes it by a long shot.
:'''Skinny Pete''': Oh please, brotha, you're frontin'.
:'''Badger''': No, man, seriously, [[w:Ashley Graham (Resident Evil)|that chick]]? The one you gotta rescue? She's smoking, bro. And then you're like the last undead dude on Earth, so how can you not be dipping into that? Talk about inspiring a brother to kick some zombie ass!
:'''Skinny Pete''': They're trying to eat your brain, bro. A dude don't need no more motivation.
:'''Badger''': That's a fair point, I guess. Okay, okay, okay, ''[[w:Call of Duty: World at War|Call of Duty: World at War]]'' zombie mode. Now that's the bomb, man. Think on it, bro. They're not just zombies: they're Nazi zombies.
:'''Skinny Pete''': Nazi zombies...
:'''Badger''': Yeah, man! SS Waffen troopers, too, which are like the baddest-ass Nazis of the whole Nazi family!
:'''Skinny Pete''': Zombies are dead, man! What difference does it make what their job was when they was living?
:'''Badger''': Dude, you are so historically retarded! Nazi zombies don't wanna eat ya just 'cause they're craving the protein. They do it 'cause, they do it 'cause they hate Americans, man. Talibans. They're the Talibans of the zombie world.
:'''Skinny Pete''': I played the game, bro. They ain't exactly fleet of foot. I'm saying, where's the challenge? At least the zombies in ''Left 4 Dead'' clock a respectable 40. You gotta lead 'em and shit.
:'''Badger''': Dude, that's 'cause they're not even zombies! They're just infected! They got like this rage virus. Amps 'em up like they've been smoking the schwag! Apples and oranges, bro. Totally unfair to compare the two.

:'''[[w:Mike Ehrmantraut|Mike]]''': ''[without turning around to look at Walter]'' You might want to learn how to tail better if you plan on making a habit of it.
:'''Walter''': May I buy you a drink? Next round when you're done.
:'''Mike''': Why not? You make a hell of a lot more than I do.
:'''Walter''': ''[to bartender]'' Another round for him and I'll have the same. No ice. ''[to Mike]'' I feel like I need to explain myself. There were some actions that I took which I want you to understand. I didn't want any of this to happen. Everything I did I did out of loyalty to my partner, and then later, of course, purely out of self-defense. I hope you can appreciate that. Just like I appreciated that... ''[waits for bartender to walk by]'' ...I appreciated that when you were going to kill me, you were simply following orders. I get that completely. And I harbor no ill will.
:'''Mike''': ''[sarcastically]'' There's a load off my mind.
:'''Walter''': Mike, I'm trying to tell you&ndash;
:'''Mike''': I get it. Fine. Drink up, Walter.
:'''Walter''': Hell of a last couple of weeks. Makes a man wonder exactly where he stands.
:'''Mike''': ''[rolls eyes and sighs]''
:'''Walter''': I mean, I cannot be alone in feeling this way. Not after what happened to Victor.
:'''Mike''': So...what's with the piece? Right hip, inside your waist band. I noticed it the other day at the lab. Now you wear it if it makes you feel better, but if push comes to shove, it's not gonna help.
:'''Walter''': Mike, do I have to come right out and say this? Now you and I, we're in the same boat.
:'''Mike''': Drink your drink.
:'''Walter''': If it happened to Victor, it can happen to you. And what the hell was that anyway? A message? He cuts a man's throat just to send a message?
:'''Mike''': You won, Walter. You got the job. Do yourself a favor and learn to take yes for an answer.
:'''Walter''': Yeah, I got the job, but for how long? Get me in a room with him. Mike, just get me in a room and I'll do the rest.
:'''Mike''': You done?
:'''Walter''': Yeah.
:''[Mike punches Walter in the face and he falls to the floor. Mike kicks Walter twice as he lies there]''
:'''Mike''': ''[putting on his jacket and stepping over Walter]'' Thanks for the drink.

:'''[[w:Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]''': Oh, seriously? Where are you two going?
:'''Badger''': Jesse, I've been awake for like three straight days. Turning into a [[w:Sleestak|Sleestak]].
:'''Jesse''': So crash here. It's not like I ain't got the space.
:'''Badger''': Yeah, that's cool and all, but I think I got like this cat? Think I'm like supposed to feed it.

:''[Marie has gone on a shopping run for Hank]''
:'''[[w:Marie Schrader|Marie]]''': I had to go to three different places to get the moisturizer that you liked, but I got that and I got your Shiner Bock and your chips and &ndash; I couldn't resist &ndash; the complete encyclopedia to fantasy football. Look, it has all the latest rankings.
:'''[[w:Hank Schrader|Hank]]''': ''[looking at the chips]'' Marie, I said Cheetos, not Fritos.
:'''Marie''': Wait, I&ndash;
:'''Hank''': I must've said Cheetos like ten times. You need me to write it down for you?
:'''Marie''': No, and I don't need you to be mean about it either, Mr. Grumpy.
:'''Hank''': Well, I'm just saying, y'know, I said Cheetos. Ch-ch-ch sound. Virtually impossible to confuse Cheetos with Fritos it seems to me. Where are you going?
:'''Marie''': Back to the store, I guess. ''[throws Hank the fantasy football magazine]'' Here.
:'''Hank''': And the draft is not for two months so this is useless!

:''[Walt and Skyler want to buy the car wash, but Bogdan refuses to sell for a lower price because of Walt's prior behavior]''
:'''[[w:Saul Goodman|Saul]]''': So where were we?
:'''[[w:Skyler White|Skyler]]''': Professionalism.
:'''Saul''': Yeah, um, so the guy won't sell, he won't sell.
:'''Skyler''': I don't accept that. I don't accept that he won't sell. I think he just lacks the proper...motivation.
:'''Saul''': Motivation? Uh, as in ''motivation'' motivation? Just so we're on the same page here, you're saying [[The Godfather|we'll make him an offer he can't refuse]]?
:'''Skyler''': Nothing so dramatic as that, no. Motivation. Attitude adjustment.
:'''Saul''': Ho ho ho ho! This one, she's a keeper. Well, I know an audit can be highly motivating. I know a gal over at Tax & Revenue, you give her ten minutes in this Bogdan fella's books, she'll have his sky raining frogs.
:'''Skyler''': No, we don't want to draw any unwanted tax attention. We don't want them looking at us after Bogdan sells.
:'''Saul''': Alright, how about an ICE raid? You know he's got illegals working over there. I mean, he just has to.
:'''Skyler''': We're not getting a bunch of poor innocent people in trouble, no.
:'''Saul''': Yeah, and also you're gonna need them after you take over. Hey, how about terrorism? "Oh, Agent Hoover I gotta tell ya, I've seen some real Islamic comings and going over there at the car wash. Yeah, I mean, guys in turbans pulling up in vans and stuff like that." Heh-heh.
:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': Saul, Bogdan is Romanian.
:'''Saul''': Okay, well, we're just spitballin' here, so...

<hr width="50%"/>
:'''Saul''': Look, there's always, "You gotta real nice place here. It'd be a shame if something happened to it." That angle.
:'''Skyler''': What are you talking about? Violence?
:'''Saul''': Attitude adjustment.
:'''Skyler''': Oh no, that, no. That is not at all what I meant. We do not do that. That is not who we are, right?
:'''Walter''': ''[slight pause]'' Yeah, no, no, no. She's right. Look, do I need to state the obvious? I mean, there's got to be dozens of car washes in this area. Who says it has to be this one?
:'''Skyler''': I do. I say it has to.
:'''Walter''': Why?
:'''Skyler''': I just do.
:'''Walter''': God...
:'''Saul''': Well, that clears things up.
:'''Skyler''': I don't like him. Bogdan. He was condescending to me, he was rude about you, and I do not like him. Simple as that.
:'''Saul''': Hey, nobody appreciates a passionate woman more than I do, but in this business &ndash; and Walt can back me up on this &ndash; the number one rule is, "Don't take things personal."
:'''Walter''': What do you mean rude about me?
:'''Skyler''': Something along the lines of you weren't man enough to face him yourself.
:'''Walter''': What?
:'''Skyler''': That you had to send your woman to do your business for you.
:'''Saul''': Okay, uh, speaking as your lawyer, I'm gonna go on record and say this is a bad idea. Now I advise against&ndash;
:'''Walter''': It's this one.

:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': "I'm terribly, terribly ashamed of my actions."
:'''[[w:Skyler White|Skyler]]''': Yeah.
:'''Walter''': Two terribly's?
:'''Skyler''': It's supposed to show contrition.
:'''Walter''': OK, I would just never use that word. I would never say the word "terribly."
:'''Skyler''': Phrase it however you want. OK, you're jumping ahead. Now...
:'''Walter''': And why am I so ashamed?
:'''Skyler''': Do I really need to answer that?
:'''Walter''': I was &ndash; and am &ndash; providing for our family.
:'''Skyler''': Let's just pick up where we left off.
:'''Walter''': I'm "weak", I'm "out of control". I mean, this whole thing makes me look like crap.
:'''Skyler''': This has to be a warts-and-all story, Walt. This is how we both sell it and we both look bad.
:'''Walter''': How do you look bad exactly? Where is the "I slept with my boss" bullet point? Because I can't seem to find that anywhere.
:'''Skyler''': For a fired school teacher who cooks crystal meth, I say you're coming out pretty much ahead.

:'''Jesse''': Yep.
:'''Mike''': Don't even want to take a wild guess? 
:'''Jesse''': ''[after a sniff]'' You're gonna kill him. Is this the part where I'm supposed to beg you not to do it? ''[puts hands together]'' Aw, please, please. ''[raises voice]'' And then what? I'm supposed to promise, cross my heart, to, like, straighten up and fly right or toe the line or some other crap that I'm not gonna say? Is that what your little show here was all about? 
:'''Mike''': You're on thin ice, you little shithead. You know that?
:'''Jesse''': You ain't gonna smoke that dude in there. I know that. You know how come I know? Because you went to the trouble of putting a blindfold on him.
:'''Jesse''': I'm going back to bed. Wipe the counter after you guys are done.

:''[Walt is venting to Saul about his problems with the business]''
:'''Walter''': Then what else should I not worry about, Saul, hm? Should I not worry that Gus plans to murder me at the first chance he gets? Should I not worry that my drug-addicted partner doesn't seem to care whether he lives or dies? You should see his house. It's like skid row! He has ''actual hobos'' living there! Now how long before Gus decides that he's too big of a risk? That guy Mike, that grunting dead-eyed cretin, sucker punching me in the face! I've got Gus wielding a box cutter! I mean...Western Union! Message received! Let me ask you, when did this stop being a business, hm? Why am I the only person capable of behaving in a professional manner?

<hr width="50%"/>
:'''Sketchy''': I'm not even kidding, because if you really think about it, you can't even see it so how can you know just how bad radio frequencies and microwaves and cell phones and stuff are getting you. I mean, you can be strolling through security at the airport on your way to see your grandma and then you get waved through a full body x-ray scanner and the next day you can be dead or dying or at least dying from all the radiation that they say is safe which there's no way it could because they have to deliver a concentrated dose, OK? Enough to penetrate your clothes and so the accumulated amount can definitely be dangerous to susceptible individuals, especially if you're from a rural area. I mean, the ozone layer is already through because of the cow farts.

:'''Mike''': I don't know! It's not my call! I just do what I'm told and now you're gonna do what you're told, which is to sit here, shut up, and stay in the car until we finish our pickups! You got it?

:'''Walter''': Jesse. Jesse! What happened yesterday? Where were you?
:'''[[w:Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]''': I was out with Mike helping make pickups.
:'''Walter''': Picking up what?
:'''Jesse''': Cash, dead drops. Mike made the pickups and I guarded him.
:'''Walter''': You...guarded Mike? What is this, some kind of a joke?
:'''Jesse''': And you know what? Two dudes tried to rob us and I saved the stash. I took care of business, just like I'm taking care of business right now. You want to stand there dicking around or do you want to suit up and get to work? Get in gear yo, if you want to do this because I'm meeting up with Mike this afternoon.
:'''Walter''': What, again? Why?
:'''Jesse''': Guess I have two jobs now.

<hr width="50%"/>
:'''[[w:Hank Schrader|Hank]]''': This guy Gale Boetticher, he was eccentric. Real character, y' know? He's, uh, he's dead now.
:'''[[w:Skyler White|Skyler]]''': Who was he?
:'''Walter Jr.''': He was a meth cook.
:'''Hank''': Uh, he was a meth chef. We're talking 5-stars, candles, and white tablecloth, y'know. I can't believe these words are coming out of my mouth, but he was a genius, plain and simple. I mean, uh, boy, if he applied that big brain of his to something good, I dunno, who knows? He could've helped humanity or something like that. I mean, how many actual geniuses are there in the world? If he'd have taken his life in a different direction, who knows?
:'''Walter''': Hank, not to tell you your business, but I'm not sure I agree.
:'''Hank''': What do you mean?
:'''Walter''': Well, you showed me that notebook and from what I saw &ndash; and this is just my humble opinion &ndash; from what I saw on those papers...genius? Not so much. I mean, there was no reasoning, no deductions in those pages, so to my eye, all this brilliance looks like nothing more than just simple rote copying, probably of someone else's work. Believe me, I have been around enough students to know. So this genius of yours, maybe he's still out there.

I mean, even if I told you, you wouldn't believe it. Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going into work? A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears! It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am ''not'' in danger, Skyler. '''''I am the danger'''''! A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. '''I am the one who knocks'''!

:'''Walter''': Alright, I need an update.
:'''[[w:Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]''': Update on what?
:'''Walter''': An update on these little field trips that you've been taking with Mike.
:'''Jesse''': I told you already we pick up money, check on things, stuff like that.
:'''Walter''': And you're his bodyguard, right? ''[Jesse turns away]'' What? What? That's what you said!
:'''Jesse''': I said I guarded him, like backup, like a second set of eyes. Everybody needs backup, right?
:'''Walter''': And this has to be you? It can't be &ndash; I don't know &ndash; Tyrus or any of the couple dozen muscleheads that Gus has working for him? It has to be Jesse Pinkman. Why? What, is there something about you I don't know? Are you a former Navy SEAL? Do you have to have your hands registered as lethal weapons?
:'''Jesse''': ''[flips Walter off]'' Register this.
:'''Walter''': All I'm saying is that do you not even question this? Do you really believe that you mean anything to these people? And I'm not trying to be insulting, I'm just trying to make you see things clearly.
:'''Jesse''': I see they can't outright kill me but they don't want me getting high. I see this thing probably started as Gus getting Mike to babysit me. But you know what? I saved Mike from getting robbed, even killed maybe. So maybe I'm not such a loser after all!
:'''Walter''': I mean, what if it...Oh God... ''[Walter thinks]'' I mean, what if it...What if it's all just a set-up?
:'''Jesse''': What?
:'''Walter''': What if this robbery that you stopped wasn't even real? I mean, think about it. Your first day out guarding Mike, he steps out for one second and what happens? You immediately get robbed.
:'''Jesse''': You are such an asshole!
:'''Walter''': Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer. Like you said, Gus can't kill you because of me. He knows that I won't stand for it. He needs me and he hates the fact that he needs me! So what does he do? He goes to work driving a wedge between you and me!
:'''Jesse''': You're an asshole. If you'd been there, you'd know it wasn't a set-up.
:'''Walter''': Wait a minute, how long did those guys chase you, huh? 'Cause the way you describe it, they gave up pretty damn easy. No, no, this whole thing &ndash; all of this &ndash; it's all about me!

:'''Walter''': A month ago, Gus was trying to kill both of us, and now he pulls you out of the lab and employs you as...what? An assistant gunman? A tough guy? Does that make any sense to you? He says he sees something in you. What kind of game is he playing? Does he think you're that naive? He can't truly think that you'd forget.

Both--''[Gus turns off the TV, pulls up a chair and sits down, facing Hector]''
:'''[[w:Gus Fring|Gus]]''': I can give you the highlights. Your nephews grew impatient. They continued to press me for my permission to kill Walter White. When I wouldn't give it, they settled instead for DEA Agent Schrader. But a phone call was placed to Agent Schrader moments before the attack, thus giving him the upper hand. Marco, shot in the face and died instantly. Leonel lingered for several hours. The warning call to the DEA agent....Juan Bolsa may have some insight into who placed it. For yesterday the ''federales'' raided his ''hacienda'', and in the confusion, Juan was shot dead. An accident, perhaps? A mistake made by his own men? But we may never know. At any rate, I thought you should hear it from me. ''[Gus pats a furious Hector on the leg and stands up to leave]'' This is what comes of blood for blood, Hector. ''Sangre por sangre.''

:...
:'''Eladio''': Sit, please. So, if your partner is the chef, then who are you? Don't tell me you are just the taster!
:'''Gus''': I handle the business operations.
:'''Max''': Gustavo is a brilliant businessman.
:'''Eladio''': Ah, a businessman! Good, good. But, tell me something. That chicken, so fabulous, so excellent... Besides that, what else do you have on your menu?
:'''Max''': We have several side dishes. Rice. Beans. Sometimes we prepare a carnitas entree if we come across fresh beef in the market.
:'''Eladio''': Anything else? Come on, be honest. There is nothing else you offer? A little taste of something else? Something on the side? Because when I send my men to your restaurant, they come back with more than just chicken. They come back with drugs. They come back high. No? You are selling them narcotics. Methamphetamine. No?
:'''Gus''': With all due respect, Don Eladio, I didn't sell it to them. I gave them samples.
:'''Eladio''': Samples.
:'''Hector''': Some businessman.
:'''Gus''': I gave them samples to give to you. To introduce you to our product.
:'''Max''': Don Eladio, Gustavo meant no offense. But he...that is to say we...could think of no other way to get your attention. We want to work with you, Don Eladio.
:'''Eladio''': I know all about methamphetamine. That's poor man's cocaine. Only bikers and hillbillies use it. There's no money in it.
:'''Max''': May I, Don Eladio...I am a biochemist by training. The methamphetamine we make is much superior to the so-called biker crank you know of. It is crystallized, like glass. Purer. And the chirality of the molecule &ndash; its very structure &ndash; is different. The narcotic effect is far more potent.
:'''Gus''': Don Eladio, this product is the drug of the future.
:'''Eladio''': Ah.
:'''Gus''': It'll triple your profits. Perhaps quadruple.
:'''Juan''': They're not only good cooks, they're great at shoveling manure.
:'''Eladio''': ''[laughing]'' No, no, no, continue, continue.
:'''Gus''': Right now, you deal almost exclusively in cocaine. But the coca plant can't grow in Mexico. You are no more than middlemen for the Colombians. They cut you a percentage for smuggling across the border. But the lion's share of the profit goes to them, despite your assumption of all the risk.
:'''Max''': This new crystal methamphetamine, it's stronger, more addictive than cocaine, which means it will move in higher volume. But most importantly, it's completely artificial. We can show you how to manufacture it, right here in Mexico.
:'''Gus''': And you keep all the profits.
:'''Eladio''': My men do like your product.
:'''Juan''': Si.
:'''Eladio''': Hector, what is wrong with you? Why did you not get glasses for our guests? Go on. ''[Hector goes to the bar]'' Good. You are quite the talent. I bet you learned cooking from your mama. Isn't that true? No? But...what about the chemistry?
:'''Max''': I studied at the University of Santiago. Gustavo paid for my education.
:'''Eladio''': Oh, really?
:'''Max''': I have degrees in both biochemistry and chemical engineering. With minimal capital investment, we can set up a factory-grade laboratory for you. Train your own people to manufacture large quantities of highly pure methamphetamine.
:'''Eladio''': Fantastic! Tell me one thing, though. If you're the cook...why do I need him?
:'''Max''': Senor?
:'''Eladio''': You. Businessman. Why should I negotiate with someone who doesn't respect me? Who insults me by dealing under my nose without my permission? Who manipulates me into a meeting in front of my own men? What do I need you for?
:'''Gus''': Don Eladio. Please. I didn't sell anything. I apologize if you are offended by my method of obtaining this meeting. I merely took the initiative. I meant no insult.
:'''Max''': Don Eladio, Gustavo didn't mean to offend. I know Gustavo like a brother. He's an honorable man. The most loyal man I have ever known. He rescued me from the Santiago slums. He made me the man I am today! Gustavo is a genius. He will make you millions! Just find it in your heart to forgive him this one small mistake. Please...He's my partner. I need him! I swear to God!
:''[Hector shoots Max in the head. Gus lunges at Hector, but Juan holds him back and pins him to the ground next to Max's dead body]''
:'''Hector''': Look at him. You did this to him. Now, look at him.

:'''Hector''': My advice...stick to chicken.

I will answer your questions. But first, I need you to answer one question for me: can you cook Walter's formula?
:'''Jesse''': What?
:'''Gus''': Walter's formula. Can you produce this product without any help alone?
:'''Jesse''': No. Why? You asking me if I can cook Mr. White's crystal without him? Me? The junkie loser you were about to waste and dump in the desert a month ago? This your plan, huh? Invite me to your house and make whatever the fuck this is? Be my buddy and make me feel important? Then get me to keep cooking for you after you kill Mr. White? You wanna talk like men? Let's talk like men: you kill Mr. White, you're gonna have to kill me, too!

<hr width="50%"/>
:'''Jesse''': Thank God. Come on in. You, uh, you want a beer or something?
:'''Walter''': No. Could I sit down?
:'''Jesse''': Oh yeah yeah, sure, go ahead. OK so, um, OK, word has come down that they want me to go to Mexico. There's some sort of war brewing between Gus and the Cartel.
:'''Walter''': Word has come down?
:'''Jesse''': The Cartel has been messing with Gus' operation, like jacking trucks to like send a message. And yesterday? That dude we brought to the lab? They shot him right in front of me! Just blew his head open! Some sniper nailed him from like a mile away. Anyway, they've been holding off but from between Cartel taking potshots and your brother-in-law trying to throw a net over the whole deal, it's like what you call a rock and a hard place situation. So Gus is gonna cave. So the Cartel wants half of Gus' entire operation and they want your formula. And he's gonna give it to them. Well, I, I gotta give it to them. I mean, I'm supposed to go to Mexico and teach a bunch of Cartel chemists how to cook a batch of blue. Y'know, Gus doesn't trust you so I gotta go! I mean, you're the chemist, man, not me. I mean, let's say I go down and go over there to the jungle or whatever and say they got actual chemists, I mean Cartel chemists, asking me chemistry stuff that I don't know how to answer because I'm not you. And what if all the equipment is in Mexican instead of English? Ugh, I dunno, I dunno, if I mess this up, I am dead. All of us! Mr. White, look, I need your help. OK, maybe you could, uh, could like coach me or something or you could give me some notes. Mr. White?

Look, there was just this one big pot of stew, OK? He just made this one big pot and we both ate from it. What was I supposed to do, huh? Poison myself?

Terrified my mother that I might have it, so they ran tests on me when I was a kid, but I came up clean. My father fell very ill when I was four, five. Spent a lot of time in the hospital. My, heh, my mother would tell me so many stories about my father. I mean, she would talk about him all the time. I knew about his personality, how he treated people, I even knew how he liked his steaks cooked: medium rare, just like you. I knew things about my father, I had a lot of information. It was because people would tell me these things. They would paint this picture of my father for me and I always pretended that was who I saw too, that I remembered. But it was all a lie. In truth, I only have one real, actual memory of my father. It must have been right before he died. My mother would take me to the hospital to visit him. And I remember the smell in there. The chemicals. It was as if they used every single cleaning product they could find in a 50 mile radius, like they didn't want you smelling the sick people. There was this stench of Lysol and bleach, you could just feel it coating your lungs. Anyway, there, lying on the bed, is my father. And he's all... he's all twisted up. My mom, she puts me on her lap, she's sitting on the bed next to him so I can get a good look at him, but really he just scares me. And he's looking right at me, but I can't even be sure he knows who I am. And your grandmother is talking, trying to be cheerful as she does, but the only thing I could remember is him breathing. There was this... this rattling sound, like if you were shaking an empty spray paint can. Like there was nothing in him. Anyway, that is the only real memory that I have of my father. I don't want you to think of me the way I was last night. I don't want that to be the memory you have of me when I'm gone.

:'''[[w:Skyler White|Skyler]]''': You really expect me to say, "Okay, Walt, sure! Just stay here and..." No. There's gotta be another way.
:'''[[w:Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter]]''': There isn't. There was...but now there isn't.
:'''Skyler''': Walt. How long till you're safe? Till you can work this out?
:'''Walter''': Oh, Skyler...
:'''Skyler''': No.
:'''Walter''': Skyler&ndash;
:'''Skyler''': No.
:'''Walter''': I have lived under the threat of death for a year now... 
:'''Skyler''': ''No''. 
:'''Walter''': ...and because of that, I've made choices.
:'''Skyler''': Walt, I&ndash;
:'''Walter''': Listen to me. I alone should suffer the consequences of those choices, no one else. And those consequences...they're coming. No more prolonging the inevitable.

:''[Gomez is searching the laundry. Jesse and Tyrus are stuck in the underground lab and Jesse is on the phone with Gus]''
:'''[[w:Gus Fring|Gus]]''': Do you know what is happening upstairs?
:'''[[w:Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]''': I have a pretty good idea.
:'''Gus''': This is all a result of your former partner. Do you understand now? Do you see why this can't continue?
:'''Jesse''': You know, I get it, the guy is a complete and total dick, but I can't. I'm not signing off, okay? Like I said, if something...final...happens to Mr. White, we're going to have a problem. So what're you gonna do?
:'''Gus''': There will be an appropriate response.

:''[Jesse walks in to Saul's office]''
:'''[[w:Saul Goodman|Saul]]''': Take a break, H.T. Let's go.
:'''Francesca''': You're going to stop calling me that or I'm gonna hang you by your tie.
:'''Saul''': Yeah, yeah, stop showing off for the client. Honey Tits! I say it's endearing.
:'''Jesse''': So, what's so important?
:'''Saul''': Well, they're here. The end times, kid. ''End'' times.
:'''Jesse''': What's that mean, and why the hell did you drag me down here for?
:'''Saul''': You want your money, don't ya? I assume that you do.
:'''Jesse''': What, that couldn't wait?
:'''Saul''': Y'ever hear the expression, "a fart in the wind," kid? Well, inside of an hour, that's gonna be me, okay? I'm hitting the road, I'm gone, I am ''out'' of here.
:'''Jesse''': What- for, like, good?
:'''Saul''': For as long as it takes. I don't like my heat so hot, if you catch my drift.
:'''Jesse''': I'm not catching, like, anything you're saying. And what the hell is your problem?
:'''Saul''': You haven't talked to your partner, have you?
:'''Jesse''': No, not since last night. ''Today'', he didn't show up to work and the DEA just happened to like, raid us. ''[Saul looks at him]'' Yeah, some coincidence, huh?
:'''Saul''': Yeah, I don't know about that. All I know is, when he tells me that your employer took him out in the desert and threaten to murder his entire family, I shut up and take notice-
:'''Jesse''': Wait, what?
:'''Saul''': -because hey, after all, what am I, if not family?
:'''Jesse''': What are you- what are you talking about? When did that happen?!
:'''Saul''': I-I don't know. Forget it &ndash; I-I mean, he exaggerates, right? He does that. Hey, listen, do me a favor: w-would you put in a good word for me with Fring? I mean, j-just for old times' sake. I can't afford to butter the wrong bread here.
<hr width="50%"/>
:'''Walter''': I don't know what you're thinking coming here. Aw Christ, what does it matter? Everything, it's all coming to an end. Do you even know what's happening? The full scope of what's happening? They took me out to the desert, they put a hood over my head and drove me out into the desert on my knees. They threatened my family, and not just Hank. My wife, my children... It's just a matter of time now. I was able to protect them for now, but...Gus is gonna make his move and...and I don't know...I don't know when or how. All I know is it's gonna happen. And I'm powerless to stop it.

:''[Jesse is pointing a gun at Walter, accusing him of poisoning his girlfriend's son, Brock]''
:'''Walter''': Jesse, why? Why, in God's name, would I poison a child?
:'''Jesse''': To get back at me! Because I'm helping Gus and this is your way of ripping my heart out before you're dead and gone! Just admit it! Admit what you did! ADMIT IT!
:'''Walter''': I DID NOT DO THIS!
:'''Jesse''': SHUT UP! ''[Jesse pushes Walter down]'' STOP LYING!
:'''Walter''': I'm not, I'm not lying, Jesse, listen to me, listen to me, what would I have to gain, what possible...possible...who...who would...Oh my God... ''[Walter begins laughing]''
:'''Jesse''': Hey. Stop laughing. STOP LAUGHING!
:'''Walter''': I have been waiting...I've been waiting all day, waiting for Gus to send one of his men to kill me, and it's you. Who do you know who's OK with using children, Jesse, who do you know? Who's allowed children to be murdered, hm? Gus! He has been ten steps ahead of me at every turn and now the one thing that he needed to finally get rid of me is your consent, and boy he's got that now, he's got it. And not only does he have that, but he manipulated you into pulling the trigger for him.
:'''Jesse''': But only you and I knew about the ricin!
:'''Walter''': No! You don't even believe that. Gus has cameras everywhere, please. Listen to yourself. No, he's known everything all along. Where were you today? In the lab? And you don't think it's possible that Tyrus lifted the cigarette out of your locker? C'mon! Don't you see? You are the last piece of the puzzle. You are everything that he's wanted. You're his cook now. You're the cook and you have proven you can run a lab without me, and now that cook has reason to kill me. Think about it! It's brilliant! So go ahead, if you think that I am capable of doing this, then go... ''[Walter grabs Jesse's wrist and puts the gun on his own forehead]'' ...put a bullet in my head and kill me right now.
:'''Jesse''': I'll do it.
:'''Walter''': DO IT! Do it.
:'''Jesse''': I'll do it!
:'''Walter''': Do it. Do it.
:''[Jesse does not pull the trigger. He turns to leave]''
:'''Walter''': Where are you going?
:'''Jesse''': I'm gonna find the son of a bitch and I'm gonna kill him.
:'''Walter''': No, don't, he'll see you coming. You'll die before you get anywhere near him.
:'''Jesse''': I don't care.
:'''Walter''': Jesse, Jesse, just get in your car, just go, just drive.
:'''Jesse''': No. I'm going to do this one way or another, Mr. White.
:'''Walter''': Then let me help.

:''[Saul Goodman interrupts an interrogation between Jesse and two officers]''
:'''Saul''': Oh, look at this! Isn't this cozy? ''[to Jesse]'' What did you tell them?
:'''Jesse''': I told them they were a couple of dicks.
:'''Saul''': He's a wordsmith. Well, detectives, it's been a pleasure. Now, up you go. Make like you've got manners. Make like you respect the rule of law. Au revoir, auf Wiederesehen, hasta luego, get the hell out! Buh-bye! That's it, pick it up. Follow your partner. And one, two. Thank you! ''[to Jesse, once the officers leave the interrogation room]'' Christ. You two. All I can say is if I ever get anal polyps, I’ll know what to name them.
:'''Jesse''': You gonna get me out of here?
:'''Saul''': No. Not even if I could. You know, the FBI's going to show up on this ricin thing, and then you're in it for the duration. You know, you're a lot safer in here. They just tried to get your partner in his own home.
:'''Jesse''': Jesus. Is he okay?
:'''Saul''': Well, he's okay like a fruit fly's okay. We're all on the clock here, and thanks for that, by the way. You two want to go stick your wangs in a hornet's nest, it's a free country. But how come I always gotta get sloppy seconds, huh?

:'''Walter''': How are you doing?
:'''Skyler''': How am I doing? How are ''you'' doing?
:'''Walter''': I'm, uh...I'm doing quite well. I'm good.
:'''Skyler''': Jesus, Walt, the news here. Gus Fring is dead. He was blown up along with some person from some Mexican cartel and the DEA has no idea what to make of it. Do you know about this? Walt? I need you to&ndash;
:'''Walter''': It's over. We're safe.
:'''Skyler''': Was this you? What happened?
:'''Walter''': ''I won''.
